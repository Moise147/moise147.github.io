They were able to capture positions in numerous different treelines and entrenched northeast of a chain of reservoirs. Other forces infiltrated further west towards the village of Varvarivka, where a large grey-zone has formed. \nTo the southeast, Russian forces advanced beyond the gulley south of Yablukove and captured new positions in the treelines on the tactical heights.

Other assault groups pushed to the south, bypassing Zatyshshya from the east, entrenching north of the Kalmychka Gulley, and beginning the envelopment of the villages of Vesele and Zelenyi Hai. \nAdditionally, Russian forces began advancing towards Vesele from the north, capturing additional positions along four parallel treelines. Ukrainian forces in turn withdrew from the northern part of the village in preparation for a full withdrawal to the west. \nFurther south, the Russians resumed their attacks towards Zelenyi Hai and Vesele from the east after previously being halted by Ukrainian fortifications and reinforcements. They reached the end of a series of treelines and captured the last stretch of a 6 km-long perpendicular treeline, consolidating just outside Zelenyi Hai.
