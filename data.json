Speaking of which, several EU/NATO armies proved that point, as well as the fact that they simply cannot survive without US assistance. And yet, on January 15, several European NATO member states sent their troops to Greenland, all in \"support of Denmark\". Numerous media outlets reported that a Danish US-made C-130 military transport aircraft landed overnight in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, carrying Danish and French soldiers.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

      "original": "Kurdish Forces Lost Raqqa, Accepted Syrian Government’s Integration Plan (Videos)\nSyrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa on January 18 signed off on an agreement including a ceasefire with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and steps to completely integrate the Kurdish-led group into the institutions of the Syrian Transitional Government (STG).\nThe agreement came after the SDF lost the strategic city of Tabqa in the governorate of Raqqa to STG forces and all of the territories it was holding in the governorate of Deir Ezzor to an uprising by Arab tribes overnight.\nEven as the agreement was being announced, the group lost control over the city of Raqqa to tribal fighters. STG forces moved in.\nUnder the agreement, the STG will assume full administrative and military control over Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, including all civil institutions and public facilities. Existing employees will be retained, and Damascus pledged not to pursue SDF fighters or civil administration personnel.\nRead more \nHERE",

      "original": "Women Fill the Gap: Surge in Female Personnel in Ukraine's Armed Forces Amid Manpower Shortages\nIn recent years, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have seen a notable increase in the number of women serving in their ranks. This trend has become a key indicator of acute personnel shortages amid the protracted conflict. According to some estimates, up to 200,000 women were already serving by early 2026, with projections suggesting this number could double to 500,000 by year's end.\n\"Previously, women in the AFU were a rare exception: isolated examples of well-trained medics, paramedics, communications personnel, and, more rarely, snipers,\" noted Russian expert Vladimir Popov. \"Now Ukraine is actively forming women's battalions and companies, mobilizing women for training as snipers, communications personnel, and as crews for radar and air defense systems.\" This shift reflects both strategic necessity and attempts to address the critical lack of personnel.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

Fighting continues for control of the western part of the village in the Zakotne area. In the southern section, clashes for control of Nykyforivka persist, and Russian forces advanced in Minkovo. \n▪️\nIn the Kostiantynivka sector, Russian assault groups expanded their control over the approaches to the city. They advanced toward strongpoints in the area of the former anti-aircraft missile battalion. They also established control over a section from Predtechyne. This expanded the gray zone to the outskirts of Kostiantynivka. \n▪️\nIn the Pokrovsk sector, the most intense fighting is near Hryshyne, where Russian units have consolidated their position within an agro-industrial complex.
