      "original": "Regarding the situation in Siversk:\nRecently, there have been a lot of differing claims from various sources about the situation in this critical city. Some are claiming that Russia has broken through and captured large parts of the city, while others say the situation is under control for Ukraine. Based on the information I have gathered, I can come to a somewhat conclusive position on what the true situation is here.\nFirstly, one major correction was made to the map. It turns out that previous Russian attempts to seize a series of Ukrainian strongpoints southeast of Siversk in September and October failed, with Ukrainian forces retaining control over important positions on the tactical heights there. The Russians instead opted to bypass these areas, advancing along the railway line and from the area of Verkhnokamyanske. \nOver the last week, attacks intensified. Russian forces assaulted and captured Ukrainian positions on the treeline leading to the southeastern edge of Siversk, which they then used to infiltrate into the city. A number of Russian soldiers scattered in the houses there, leaving the Ukrainian strongpoints to the southeast in an operational encirclement. \nHowever, the main vector of attack on Siversk took place from the south. A number of Russians on motorcycles broke into the southern part of the city, which was already in the grey zone. The surviving infantry then advanced north towards the city centre, scattering in additional residential areas and linking up with the forces from the east. This was achieved with minimal resistance from Ukrainian soldiers on the ground due to Ukrainian manpower shortages inside the city itself, as well as new logistical problems which Ukraine is facing due to recent Russian advances on the flanks. \nDespite this small number of Ukrainian soldiers, a massive number of drones remain in the sky as usual, monitoring every movement and striking anything that moves. Russia deployed only a small number of soldiers in these attacks (likely 30-50, not including already established positions on the southern outskirts), which is not enough to consolidate larger areas and bring in additional supplies and reinforcements. Naturally, due to a lack of Ukrainian manpower, drone operators are now attempting to pick off the Russian soldiers to prevent any consolidation, ahead of small assault groups moving in. Currently, only a portion of the Russian soldiers have been killed/wounded, and work is underway to find the rest of them. Earlier strikes mainly took place in the southern parts of the city but are now moving further north to hit the Russians who penetrated deeper. \nMeanwhile to the south of Siversk, Russian forces have made new advances in Zvanivka. They captured at least 60% of the village, reached its western edge, and are now trying to push further north and consolidate on its northern edge. Advances also took place downhill from the tactical heights next to the railway line, forcing the remaining Ukrainian soldiers still in the salient northeast of Pereizne to withdraw.",

      "original": "Russia is winning the war; therefore any peace negotiations will favour them.\nPeople are so hooked up on hopium, and are looking at this from an idealist point of view. War doesn't work like a Hollywood movie where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. The stronger side wins and the weaker side loses - at least in a war of attrition. \nThe fact that people think THIS plan is unacceptable to Ukraine is insane to me and shows how delusional many have gotten. With how things are going, in the next year and a half Ukraine likely will have been defeated. \nEven for people who see this war as a linear \"Russia took X number of kilometres in Y amount of time, therefore it will take 200 years for them to get to Kyiv\" are being proven wrong by reality now. Using that logic, at this current rate of advance, Russia will reach the Dnipro River at Zaporizhzhia City (a city of over 700k people) in less than a year. The linear claim used to be 90 years, or 1,000 years. \n\"Oh, but Russia could just leave, why should Ukraine cede territory!\" Trump could also resign today, Elon Musk could donate $50 Billion to charity. The amount of brain rotting shit that people try to portray as actual arguments is mind numbing.\nThis isn't how war works. Why would Russia leave? They are winning and know they will win if they keep pushing. People are seriously conflating reality with their perception of an ideal situation, and the fact that this opinion is so widely accepted and promoted is proof of what emotional attachments to entities (Ukraine), and propaganda can do.",
