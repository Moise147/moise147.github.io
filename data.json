The platform was, according to the company, developed based on experience gained from real-world use in Ukraine, which highlights the country’s growing role as a testbed for Western weapons, especially more controversial artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\nThe Nemyx represents a “major step forward” in the field of military and surveillance drone technology, according to Auterion.\nThe company said that the platform enables operators to centrally manage entire fleets of drones that can be from different manufacturers, as long as they are equipped with the AuterionOS operating system.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
