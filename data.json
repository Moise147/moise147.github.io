FABs also targeted almost every part of the village held by the AFU, causing significant casualties among their forces and slowing their advance. \nRussian FAB glide-bombs then struck the bridge between the two reservoirs, connecting the centre to the eastern part of the village, to complicate further Ukrainian movement west. The remaining Russian soldiers were then withdrawn from the village centre. \nDespite this extensive bombardment, Ukrainian soldiers managed to cross the tributary and establish positions in a few houses in the northwest of the village. The Russians tried to cut off the Ukrainians in the northwest by attacking to the northern street from the area of the reservoirs but were forced to retreat back after encountering heavy resistance, indicating further Ukrainian reinforcements have been getting brought in. \nAt the same time, Ukrainian forces had to withdraw from the gulley west of Kindrativka back to the treeline to the south, after being hit by over a dozen FABs and failing to consolidate. It's likely that this was a diversionary attack for the main operation on Kindrativka from the west, tying up Russian forces and complicating their movement in and out of the village.\n+ ~4.95km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

Other forces then crossed the fields to Varachyne, where fierce battles ensued for the eastern houses. Russian forces exploited Ukraine's weakened forward position northwest of Varachyne and was able to push from Novomykolaivka to the intersection of three treelines, applying additional pressure on the Ukrainian soldiers in Varachyne. \nEventually Russian soldiers captured the village, and established full control over the treelines to the north.

They advanced east along the railway line, utilising the cover from the windbreaks on either side of the tracks to infiltrate Russian trench positions and dugouts, recapturing them and reaching the main trench strongpoints at the bridge. \nOnce this strongpoint was under Ukrainian control, and positions had been recaptured in the adjacent forest, small groups of Ukrainian soldiers moved east across the open fields and infiltrated the southeastern part of Stepova Novosilka at two points. \nMeanwhile, Russian soldiers slightly improved their positions to the north, crossing a gulley and establishing control over a small treeline to the west. \n+ ~2.28km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.33km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

I agree with a lot of this, although I believe the actual speed is a little more than Mach 5, not due to delays in explosions but rather delays in detection due to them usually flying over border and lightly populated areas of Chernihiv Oblast. \nUsually, we don't know about it until it is either approaching Kyiv Oblast or already over the region - sometimes even only when the explosion is heard in Kyiv from the Mach Cone phenomenon. I think it's probably closer to Mach 6, but that's just speculation. \n@cym27s\n is a good person to follow. He's one of the two other main English-speaking missile trackers and does very similar work to me - but also at hours when I'm not online or asleep. Go get him to 9k followers, and also try to convince him to make a telegram channel lol.\nThread link: \nhttps://x.com/cym27s/status/1947592482172375112",

      "original": "I'd like to point something out regarding the recent DRG operations, and specifically the attached video showing a Russian sabotage operation deep inside Pokrovsk City.\nThis is nothing new - at least in the sense that these deep infiltrations behind the frontlines have been occurring for several months now. As I and many others have been pointing out for a long time, Ukrainian manpower problems will eventually reach a point where they are unable to contain Russian infantry. Right now, we are at the point where they cannot contain all DRGs and are failing to kill them within the required period of 12-24 hours. \nDRGs have been constantly slipping behind Ukrainian lines simply because there are no soldiers to stop them in some areas. They utilise cover from treelines, windbreaks and the more lightly damaged settlements to evade being spotted by drones, and then carry out sabotage operations on Ukrainian positions multiple kilometres behind the frontline on unaware soldiers and commanders in temporary deployment points. This is what I mean when I point out how relying on one thing to hold parts of the frontline (drones) is not a good tactic nor a good sign as it significantly simplifies Russian assault operation - they don't have to account for as many factors. \nYes, the number of DRG operations in the Pokrovsk direction has significantly increased, but the main reason we are seeing this is because of how much attention Pokrovsk is getting right now. This is a common occurrence in weak sections of the frontline, and even sometimes much more stable sectors such as the frontline northwest of Bakhmut.",
