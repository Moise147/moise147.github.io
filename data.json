This has been achieved after weeks of Ukrainian counterattacks. There is currently no evidence of consolidation there, however.\nThe red shows the main Russian strongholds in western Kupyansk, which the Ukrainians are either bypassing or directly assaulting. \nThe situation has reached this point due to a severe lack of Russian manpower within Kupynask. This is due to a lack of Russian consolidation north of the city, making logistics (which already have to go over the river further north which is monitored 24/7 by Ukrainian drones) incredible difficult. For this reason, Russian soldiers in western Kupyansk likely number between just 200 and 400.\nThe fact that Russian forces managed to break into Kupyansk and quickly capture large parts of the city is evidence of how poorly the Ukrainian defence was initially conducted here, and how critical their manpower shortages were. \nHowever, due to reinforcements being brought in, Ukraine achieved a localised numerical superiority in this area, which is allowing for them to carry out these successful counterattacks. \nThis is why I warned about this sector a week ago, and how it could become critical for Russian forces. Since then, the situation has absolutely reached a critical level.",
