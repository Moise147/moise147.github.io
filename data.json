Russian DRGs are now operating in southern Myrnohrad, with the first two streets currently in the grey zone.\nTo the west, Russian forces resumed assault operations from the area of Shevchenko, and broke through Ukrainian positions along the railway line. They were able to occupy most of the remaining strongpoints in the railway intersection area, before pushing further east along both banks of the Solonenkyi River towards the village of Novoukrainka. Novoukrainka quickly fell, while the Russians also captured the surrounding positions and established control over around half of the village of Chunyshyne. Despite this, the large guitar-shaped trench fortification to the south is yet to be seized.\nTo the northwest, following high activity of Russian DRGs in and around Pokrovsk, Russian forces were able to establish full control over the rest of Zvirove and the adjacent terykon, before establishing a foothold in the Kalynivka district of Pokrovsk in the area of Kyyivska Street. Positions in the treeline and fortifications to the south were also captured. In addition to this, Russian forces captured the rest of the main part of Leontovychi.\nIn the west, Russian forces resumed their assault operations west of Pokrovsk, and improved their positions in a forested area, capturing a small section of the T-0406 Highway. \n+ ~8.67km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
