They moved along a treeline and a chain of forests, establishing control over previously lost positions there. From there, they advanced downhill and east to the outskirts of Hrekivka, recapturing the positions in the low-lying ground there. The Russians were also able to recapture the western edge of the forest towards the swamp on the Kharkiv-Luhansk-Donetsk tri-border point.\nIn the west, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions west of the Nitrius River, significantly expanding their small bridgehead on its western bank. They pushed north through the rest of Hlushchenkove, completing the capture of the village, and began propelling northwards towards Andriivka, threatening to cut off Azov in the salient to the east. Russian forces also advanced west to the tactical heights, seizing new treeline positions and pushing towards the village of Maliivka.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations in Novomykhailivka and Ridkodub, without making any confirmed progress. \n+ ~14.27km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

As a result of recent actions, this goal has been achieved, and the remaining road east of the river resupplying Shandryholove has been physically cut. \nRussian forces advanced from their newly captured positions on the tactical heights northeast of Derylove, as well as from the eastern outskirts of Shandryholove, to the forest plantations southeast of the village. They continued to bypass it, moving further west to the next set of forest plantations, before reaching and cutting the road, and entrenching on the eastern bank of the Nitrius River. \nAs a result, Shandryholove has now been taken into an operational encirclement, as there are no bridges connecting the Ukrainian salient to the western bank of the river.

In the north, they continued their assault operations to recapture the village of Myrne, advancing south and downhill to the next set of forest plantations. Other forces moved further west, capturing a small farm and gaining a foothold on the southern end of a forested area. Fighting is currently ongoing for the forests west of Myrne, where Ukrainian forces are surrounded on three sides.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces continued their assault on Zarichne, and managed to recapture the Torske Fish Farm after Ukrainian forces withdraw over the Zherebets River. Russian forces then crossed the river at this section, gaining a foothold in the northern part of Zarichne and linking up with their bridgehead in the centre of the village. Fighting is now ongoing for Ozerna Street, which is partially in the grey zone.\nIn the south, after repeated DRG activities, Russian forces were able to cross the Zherebets River at a third point and entered the southern part of Zarichne. They established a foothold at the eastern end of Spartaka and Bulvarna Streets. At the same time, other forces from the central bridgehead advanced south down Poshtova Street, approaching a tributary of the Zherebets River where other Russian formations are entrenched. \n+ ~9.06km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "In the Dobropillya direction, over the past week Ukrainian forces have continued to decrease the size of the Russian salient, and are now attempting to cut it off at the base.\nOn the eastern flank of the salient, following the arrival of additional reinforcements, Ukrainian forces crossed the Kazenyi Torets River into Volodomyrivka, took up positions in the kill-zone they had previously set up, and began clearing the rest of the village. They were able to reach the agricultural buildings, and recapture most of the settlement. From there, attacks were made from Shakhove to the west and northwest, where positions in three separate forest plantations were recaptured. Ukrainian forces also re-established control over the western approaches to Toretske, as well as the treelines further west, after the Russians withdrew to shorten their line of contact. \nOn the western flank of the salient, Azov resumed their assault operations after a brief pause which occurred in part due to intensified Russian FAB glide-bomb strikes. Supported by forces east of Novyi Donbas, they advanced from the treelines west of Vilne into Nove Shakhove, recapturing the village. From there they began to attack further west down the treelines, with the goal of cutting the Russian salient off at the base.\nTo the north, due to Azov's success in Nove Shakhove, Russian forces began withdrawing from their newly captured positions in and around Rubizhne. Ukrainian forces re-established control over Rubizhne, as well as at least part of the treelines on the tactical heights east of the village. Ukrainian forces also began attacking from Vilne towards Kucheriv Yar, recapturing positions in the forest plantations in the low-lying ground next to the Velyka Balka Gulley, as well as on an adjacent treeline. \n+ ~26.13km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

In the northwest, after regrouping in Leontovychi and repelling Ukrainian attacks, they advanced into western Pokrovsk and began clearing the private sector on the edge of the city. From there, they pushed northeast up four parallel residential streets towards the E-50 highway, which they are now operating in the vicinity of. The Russians were also able to re-establish control over the surroundings of the terykon next to Leontovychi, and after roughly five days of fighting, secured the western half of the village of Troyanda. The eastern half is in the grey-zone, with both sides regularly operating there.\nTo the southeast, after pausing their attacks on Chunyshyne, Russian forces were finally able to establish control over the guitar-shaped trench fortification northeast of Zelene, while other forces captured the rest of the forests north of Dachenske. They were also able to capture most of a treeline northwest of Lysivka.\n+ ~7.62km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
