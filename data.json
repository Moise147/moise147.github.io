They quickly reached Dahdouh Road from the southeast and are now within 1.15 km of the coast. Israeli forces have now taken up positions in a residential quarter (31.50155, 34.42969) in the first part of the partially destroyed coastal Sheikh Ijlin Neighbourhood. \nTo the northeast, the IDF continued pushing from Jabalia at their usual pace and entered into the Gaza Governorate in the area of the Al Sheik Radwan Pool. They began clearing operations towards Gaza City centre from this area, capturing several dense residential blocks (31.52189, 34.4701 & 31.5241, 34.47019), before armoured units began their main vector of attack northwest down Kamal Naser Street. Here they advanced for close to 500 metres, reaching Al-Jala Street, where they expanded for about 240 metres through the dense residential blocks to the southwest (31.52593, 34.46655). \n+ ~1.80 km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",

They were able to quickly clear and capture the outlying streets (31.5529, 34.4642), reaching the edge of the Madinat Al 'Awada Neighbourhood from the north (31.54792, 34.46454).
