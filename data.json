Speaking of which, several EU/NATO armies proved that point, as well as the fact that they simply cannot survive without US assistance. And yet, on January 15, several European NATO member states sent their troops to Greenland, all in \"support of Denmark\". Numerous media outlets reported that a Danish US-made C-130 military transport aircraft landed overnight in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, carrying Danish and French soldiers.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
