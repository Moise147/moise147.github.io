He said that met separately in Damascus with the Minister of Defense and the head of the intelligence service, noting that there was “an understanding on the principle of decentralization” in governance, with ongoing discussions about the interpretation of related terms.\nAbdi’s recent remarks show a lot of optimism, but the situation on the ground indicates that a battle between the SDF and the government is nearing.\nRead more \nHERE",
