After the last section of the Siversky Donets line fell, Russian forces began focusing on capturing positions outside the large, fortified forest southeast of Stupochky, and then storming it. Neither of these goals were achieved. \nAfter their successful defence in the forest, Ukrainian forces then attempted a series of counterattacks towards the highway northwest of Predtechyne, but were unsuccessful. However, this did tie up Russian forces in the area and eventually led to the Russians attempting to advance towards the eastern dachas of Kostyantynivka. Nevertheless, Ukrainian forces were able to consolidate in the forest north of the highway and began advancing towards Predtechyne. They secured isolated positions west of the village, before entering it and taking up positions in the western houses. Russian forces, who had supply issues due to the increase in Ukrainian FPV drone attacks from Kostyantynivka, withdrew to the eastern houses. \n+ ~9.09 km² in favour of Ukraine.",

In the west, following Russian withdrawals to shorten the line of contact, Ukrainian forces advanced from their newly recaptured positions west of Rubizhne and northeast of Stepy, recapturing the rest of the treelines on the tactical heights. From there, forces from 12th Special Forces Brigade \"Azov\" advanced from the treelines north of Vilne, and cleared part of the Velyka Balka Gulley. They then crossed the Hruzke River, capturing further positions in the forest plantations, and entered the village of Kucheriv Yar. It is currently unclear if they were able to establish a permanent presence in the settlement, however. Additionally, Ukrainian forces advanced from their positions south of Zolotyi Kolodyaz and cleared the northernmost part of the Velyka Balka Gulley, facilitating the entry into Kucheriv Yar.\nIn the east, after capturing the treelines on the tactical heights west of Toretske, Ukrainian forces from the 93rd Mechanised Brigade advanced north down the gulley south of Hruzke, forcing the remaining Russian formations stationed east of the Shakhove - Hruzke road to withdraw to positions in the treelines south of Kucheriv Yar. \n+ ~15.57km² in favour of Ukraine.",

After reinforcements were brought in, they began storming the village of Fillya. They entered the southern houses and took up positions there. Ukrainian forces, utilising the trench fortifications in the forest to the north were able to hold the northern part of the settlement, and launched a few counterattacks, however these were repelled. Russian forces responded by dropping several FAB glide-bombs on this forest. \nTo the east, Ukrainian forces continued their slow advance towards Dachne. They completed the capture of the forest west of the village, and secured positions in the treeline to the east. Other forces then advanced south from the treelines in the area of the highway and captured the large trench fortification on the northern approaches to the village. This fortification was then used to enter Dachne, where they captured the western houses.
