They were able to break through from the north, occupying various trench networks, and reaching the holiday resort on the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River. Additional progress was made along the whole line of contact to the east, including along the northern bank of the river. It's unclear if there are any Ukrainian soldiers still in the eastern part of the forest, but if there are they are now surrounded. \nTo the northwest, Russian forces continued to advance in Torske, and after further consolidating their positions in the northern part of the village and bringing in more reinforcements, they made further progress to the south, capturing the central and eastern parts of the settlement, including the church.
