It can operate from improvised airstripes and is designed for easy maintenance (a team of 10 conscripts and a specialist are enough for most of the maintenance tasks).\nThis rusticity is what allows the Ukrainian Airforce to survive years into the war.\nBut the Gripen E has also advanced avionics, EW and can use the Meteor air-to-air missile, an improvement from the AIM-120 of the F-16s.\nThe memorandum is not a contract, don't expect the Gripens to fight this war.\n@wfwitness",
