Cambodia is now shelling these occupied positions with artillery. \nThai reinforcements are reportedly moving towards the border along highway 4120 (around 33km east of this initial incursion), with Cambodian sources reporting that their artillery shelling in the region targeted them. \nMass evacuations of civilians in border provinces in both Cambodia and Thailand are underway.
