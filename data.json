      "original": "Update from the Kupyansk direction: \nBoth Russian and Ukrainian forces are continuing their assault operations, each advancing on a different side of the Oskil River.\nIn the southwestern part of Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces continued their clearing operations and recaptured additional positions on Levadna and Dmytriyivska Streets and in the garage cooperative. They also recaptured the rest of the houses west of the Yuvileynyi high-rise micro-district and entered its southern apartment buildings as well as the boarding school. Other forces are now trying to bypass it from the north and enter another garage cooperative, in an attempt to encircle the remaining Russian soldiers in the northern high-rise buildings. \nIn the western part of Kupyansk, the Ukrainians continued to clear the residential blocks west of the railway line and reached the highway. Some assault groups are pushing further east towards the city centre, reaching the gymnasium and the furniture factory. They also managed to advance north from the grain elevators, entering the City Central Hospital and capturing additional positions in the blocks to the west, forcing the remaining Russian formations stations to the northwestern streets to withdraw to the city centre.\nIn the northwestern part of Kupyansk, following the Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian forces quickly established control over large parts of the residential areas there and are now attempting to clear the area of the bread factory and a number of nearby enterprises. Fighting is also ongoing for the \"Comb\" stronghold, which contains 19 high-rise buildings and several other smaller buildings. \nIn the northern part of Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations and finally managed to consolidate on Michurina and Mechnikova Streets, thereby physically cutting all Russian ground supply into the western part of the city. Additionally, they were able to consolidate in new residential areas in and around Lenina Street and entered the city centre from the north where they are trying to clear the Spartak Stadium, School No. 6, and a number of surrounding apartment buildings.\nNorth of Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces captured the rest of the enterprises on the northern outskirts of the city and entered the nearby forests. Additionally, at some point recently, they re-established full control over the village of Radkivka.\nFurther north, Ukrainian forces consolidated in the western streets of Kindrashivka, which were already in the grey-zone. They then consolidated in the treelines north of Kindrashivka and entered the eastern part of the village, forcing the Russian formations stationed there to withdraw east and allowing for the settlement to be brought back under full Ukrainian control. From there, the Ukrainians began a push to the north, recapturing two large forests on either side of the R-79 Highway. \nEast of Kupyansk, over the last week, Russian forces have been carrying out a series of assault operations aimed at eliminating the Ukrainian presence northeast of Kupyansk. They were able to capture the remaining industrial buildings on the eastern edge of the city and began pushing through Ukrainian positions in the forests further east. As a result, the Russians entered the southwestern houses of Kucherivka and captured a large part of the settlement. \nThis forced the remaining Ukrainian formations to withdraw from Synkivka and the nearby areas, officially ending a nearly 2.5-year-long battle for this village, and allowing for the Russians to nearly fully secure the area north of the Hnylytsya River. Additionally, Russian forces managed to consolidate the remaining parts of northern Petropavlivka, while clearing operations continue in the northwestern houses where Ukrainian forces have withdrawn through from Synkivka. \n+ ~13.23 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~9.97 km² in favour of Russia.",
