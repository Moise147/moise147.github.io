The trenches were mostly covered by FPV drones, but a lack of drone operators allowed for the Russians to advance even quicker, rapidly approaching the village of Pryvilne, and bypassing Novohryhorivka.\nWith Novohryhorivka in a dangerous salient, any remaining Ukrainian soldiers withdrew, allowing for the Russians to infiltrate the village and establish control over it, as well as the positions to the north, west, and south. At the same time, assault operations were carried out towards Pavlivka from the north, which is now in a grey zone and covered by drones.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces closed the distance to the Yanchur River, pushing along the treelines, and downhill from the tactical heights into the village of Novovasylivkse, which was quickly brought under control following a Ukrainian withdrawal over the river. The Russians were also able to establish control over the part of Novomykolaivka situated east of the river, as well as the treelines to the southeast, leading to a tributary of the river. \nIn the south, Russian forces broke through from positions west of Olhivske to the hamlet of Okhotnyche, which was quickly captured, alongside the treelines on the tactical heights to the south. Additionally, Russian forces secured the rest of the houses of Poltavka east of the river, and improved their positions in the direction of the village from the southeast, as well as north of Malynivka. \n+ ~38.37 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They then entered Sichneve from the north, and established control over the northern part of the village, as well as the nearby treelines on the tactical heights. Since then, a series of Russian counterattacks forced the Ukrainians to withdraw from both Sichneve and Novoselivka, with both villages now being situated in the grey zone. \nIn the west, Ukrainian forces began attacking towards Sosnivka, and established control over the northwestern-most street of the village. They entered the main part of the village shortly afterwards, although there is no evidence of consolidation at this moment. Positions were also recaptured in the adjacent treelines. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces infiltrated through the grey zone of mixed positions for around 4.5 km to the eastern edge of Oleksiivka, which they were able to infiltrate.
