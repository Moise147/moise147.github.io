The violence began at the ancient, disputed Ta Muen Thom temple site in the Thai province of Surin, which was claimed by Cambodia, before spreading out to other border areas.\nThe situation escalated after the Cambodian military fired Grad 122 mm rockets at a gas station in the town of Ban Phue in the Thai province of Sisaket. The Thai Health Ministry said that at least 11 civilians were killed.\nIn response, F-16 fighter jets of the Thai air force attacked two Cambodian regional military headquarters.
