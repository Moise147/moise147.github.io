As a result of this, Ukraine was forced to withdraw from the village of Serebryanka, and is now holding a defence from three sides in Dronivka. Russian forces have also recaptured the rest of Serebryanka, as well as the surrounding positions, and are now trying to permanently establish themselves in the chalk quarry. \nThe Russians were also able to fully secure the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, aligning the front along the Donetsk - Luhansk Regional Border, and officially ending the battles for the Severodonetsk District of Luhansk Oblast which have been ongoing since the first days of the war. \nTo the west, Russian forces marginally advanced towards Dronivka from the west, securing new positions in the forest on the western bank of the Siverskyi Donets River. \nIn the west, Russian forces continued their offensive on Yampil. They were able to consolidate control over additional positions in the eastern part of the village, including at the railway station, and are continuing their attacks beyond the village centre (which is currently in the grey zone).

From there, they entered eastern Verbove with little resistance and occupied at least half of the village, including the agricultural buildings. The intensity of FAB glide-bomb strikes in this area is increasing, with Ukrainian temporary deployment points and fortifications constantly being struck.\nAdditionally, Russian forces advanced north from their positions west of Berezove, and captured the one-house \"village\" of Stepove.
