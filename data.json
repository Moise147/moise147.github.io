The cargo likely consists of Kh-22 cruise missiles for the Tu-22M3 strategic bombers stationed at Diaghilev Airbase, Ryazan Oblast, but it's possible that the cargo only included Geran-2/3 and Gerbera drones for launch sites in Bryansk and Smolensk Oblasts.\n1 An-26 cargo plane landed at Khalino Airbase, Kursk Oblast.
