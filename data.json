Another FAB-250 was seen impacting a nearby residential area. \nAs seen in the second video, the bridge survived but now has a large hole in the middle. This will complicate supplies to the Ukrainian garrison stationed on Korabelnyi Island, as well as the remaining civilians still living there.",

They were able to break out of the village, and captured the treeline to the north. Once reinforcements were brought in, a four-vector attack was carried out on the positions on the western approaches to Oleksiivka. Russian forces were pushed back into the village, and back to the forest plantations lining the reservoir to the north. \nAn attack was carried out on the agricultural buildings on the western outskirts of Oleksiivka, which are now in the grey zone. Ukrainian forces also have fire control over the last road out of the village, significantly complicating Russian movement in and out of it. \n+ ~4.48km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

West of the river, the Russians advanced further south down four different residential streets and captured the farm buildings to the west.\n+ ~1.49km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They completed the capture of the southeastern streets, establishing control over the adjacent trench strongpoint, while improving their positions in the south of the village. \nA mechanised attack was then carried out with the goal of securing the road from Serebryanka, but this was repelled with significant losses. \nSouth of the Plotka River, Russian forces were able to recapture positions in and around the orchards between the reservoirs and began a general push westward along the treelines. Once a solidified presence was established north of the large reservoir, Russian soldiers stormed the trench networks at the terykon overlooking Siversk. They crossed the ponds and cleared the trenches, establishing a presence on the eastern slope of the terykon.\nTo the south, Russian forces moved back into western Verkhnokamyanske - which was in the grey zone - and cleared the largely empty positions in the basements of the ruins. \n+ ~18.84km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
