They consolidated in the windbreaks on either side of the railway tracks and entrenched in the southeastern houses of Novopidhorodne. They were also able to advance along the treeline north of Molodetske, while other forces enter the forest plantations next to the gulley to the northeast.\nIn the east, Russian forces advanced further north from western Udachne, capturing new treeline positions and entering the western part of the Pokrovsk Coal Mine.

Consolidation is ongoing in many areas.\nIn the west, after earlier infiltrations by DRGs, Russian forces advanced from western Ivanivka to the large forest east of Havrylivka, where they established control over most of it.

At the same time, they advanced further west through the treelines on the tactical heights south of Danylivka, capturing positions in numerous different treelines, and beginning attacks to the southwest in the direction of Radisne. Other forces advanced south through the treelines west and northwest of Zlahoda, seizing new positions there too.\nTo the south, after capturing Solodke and entering Rivnopillya, Russian forces continued to build on their momentum and advanced for more than 3.3 km through the treelines on the tactical heights to the southwest of Solodke. This was done in conjunction with other forces advancing directly west from Solodke, and through the treelines northwest of Rivnopillya. Meanwhile, the Russians completed the capture of Rivnopillya and Yablukove after approximately two days of fighting, and began advancing further west beyond these two settlements, where they captured new treeline positions towards the rear of Hulyaipole. \nTo the southwest, after capturing Yablukove, Russian forces began a series of attacks along the tactical heights towards the village of Zatyshshya. They were able to advance for around 3 km, bypassing Vesele from the west and approaching the eastern outskirts of Zatyshshya. Other forces levelled the frontline between this new spearhead and the positions north of Vesele. \nIn the south, Russian forces improved their positions northeast of Vesele, reaching the northeastern outskirts of the village and capturing a treeline north of the Hulyaipole - Malynivka Road.

      "original": "Yesterday's events in Damascus foreshadow a potential inter-terrorist conflict in Syria in the coming months. ISIS has managed to infiltrate STG forces (formerly HTS + other terrorist groups) and the country's major cities. They have moved from systematic killings to multi-pronged attacks against civilian targets (mainly minorities) as well as military targets (attacks on Damascus authorities' checkpoints). The most interesting aspect of this change in dynamics lies in the attempted attacks against Jolani, which have revealed a deep rift between the security forces, which must be supplemented by Turkish and US intelligence.\nDespite Washington's resounding support (to the detriment of the SDF) and the limited lifting of sanctions as well as normalization (recognition of a terrorist as a Syrian “leader”), Jolani faces an internal danger that he can hardly resolve by opposing his own nature.\nComparisons are odious, but the Libyan formula seems to prevail in the face of events.\nMay God protect decent Syrians.\n🙏🏻",
