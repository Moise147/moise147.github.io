They first advanced south down the Donetsk-Dnipropetrovsk Regional Border to the poorly consolidated Russian positions in northern Molodetske, which subsequently shifted into the grey-zone. \nThen, without consolidating, the Ukrainians infiltrated further east along the railway line and are trying to accumulate just west of Udachne. Russian FPV drone operators are attempting to cover the infiltration routes in order to limit the number of soldiers reaching the western approaches to the town. \nIn the east, Ukrainian forces counterattacked in the direction of the railway line between Kotlyne and Udachne, recapturing positions along three parallel treelines. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued their attacks both east and west of the Pokrovsk Coal Mine's waste dumps, while DRGs began infiltrating further northwest through the forest plantations in the direction of Serhiivka. \n+ ~1.44 km² in favour of Ukraine.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

Other forces in central Rodynske managed to infiltrate the former \"Zaporozhskaya\" Mine west of the city. Fighting also continues for central Zatyshok, where the Russians are trying to dislodge the remaining Ukrainian soldiers.\nTo the north, Russian forces managed to consolidate in two more clay mines, along with additional forested areas and treelines.

Renewed fighting is also ongoing for Ivanivka, and Russian soldiers are continuing their attacks in western Nove Shakhove.\nTo the northeast, Russian forces continued advancing north from Shakhove and captured new positions southwest of Toretske.

However, more recently, they have begun struggling with supplies due to increased Ukrainian FPV drone strikes on the area between the city and Oleksandro-Shultyne. \nMeanwhile, at some point recently, Ukrainian forces managed to clear the Hora District of northeastern Kostyantynivka from Russian DRGs, as well as the adjacent forests, where they are now trying to accumulate.
