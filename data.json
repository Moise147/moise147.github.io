      "original": "General overview and analysis of the Pokrovsk direction:\nI have numbered the different sub-sectors on the map to correspond with this post. The green lines represent the usable supply routes into Pokrovsk. \n1. Russian forces continue consolidating in the agricultural buildings on the northern outskirts of Udachne after it moved out of the grey zone. They are also attempting to consolidate and expand their zone of control in the eastern buildings of the Pokrovsk Coal Mine, however Ukrainian FPV drone strikes are impeding any progress. \n2. Russian forces continue to slowly advance in Kotlyne, and have managed to complete the capture of the village after securing the rest of the houses in the grey zone, as well as the small farm to the north. The overall goal in this sector is to capture the Pokrovsk Mine, secure the surroundings of Kotlyne, and begin attacks towards the Serhiivka area in order to bring the E-50 highway to Pokrovsk under fire control.\n3. Russian forces continue infiltration attempts in the Durniak and Pervomaika Districts in western Pokrovsk, with the grey zone now extending for more than 800 metres. Both sides are actively using FPV drones against each other to prevent infantry from accumulating. \n4. Russian soldiers continue to enter the Lazurnyi District of southern Pokrovsk and accumulate in the basements of high-rise buildings. From there, they move further north into the neighbouring Pivdennyi, Shakhtarskyi, and Soniachnyi Districts, but have been unsuccessful in gaining a foothold. Small Ukrainian assault groups constantly move in and clear out Russian soldiers from the basements of high-rise buildings, while the Russians do the same to the Ukrainians, resulting in a large grey zone forming with no coherent line of contact. However, the Russians were able to secure the northern part of the Lazurnyi District, where consolidation is now ongoing. \n5. After capturing Chunyshyne, Russian forces continued advancing north through the windbreaks on either side of the railway tracks, but are being caught in a kill-zone controlled by the air from Ukrainian FPV drones. Nevertheless, some Russian soldiers have managed to reach the western edge of Novopavlivka, although no consolidation has occurred yet. \n6. Russian forces continue attempts at infiltrating the village of Balahan from the forests to the east after the first attacks were repelled. So far, no advances have been confirmed, as some of the more effective Ukrainian units are stationed in Myrnohrad and the surrounding areas, compared to in much of Pokrovsk where there is no cohesive defence on the ground. However, Russia is accumulating large amounts of infantry in the Mykolaivka area in preparation for future attacks towards and into eastern Myrnohrad.\n7. Russian forces advanced into the treelines and fortifications directly north of Myrnohrad, however no consolidation has occurred yet, likely due to the lack of control over the mine area and the difficult situation further west. Russia is also accumulating large forces in the Novoekonomichne area in preparation for attempts to clear the grey zone and break into northeastern Myrnohrad. \n8. Following the end of the fierce battles for the pig farms and surrounding positions south of Rodynske, over the past 5 days Ukrainian forces have launched a series of counterattacks on the Russian flanks. They advanced from the city of Rodynske, back into western Chervonyi Lyman, where they were able to secure the western houses of the village. Fighting is ongoing for the central part. Other forces are attempting to clear the treelines south of the settlement, where a grey zone has now formed. Meanwhile, further north, Ukrainian forces are continuing their attempts at re-entering Sukhetske, but have been unsuccessful so far. \nOverall, the situation remains very difficult and complicated for the Ukrainians. A severe lack of manpower and important positions being lost west of Pokrovsk points towards a worsening situation down the line, which could involve one of the last remaining roads into the city being bro",
