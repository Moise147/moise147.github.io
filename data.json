Most of the progress was made in the southeast, where after a series of failed attacks on Shandryholove, the Russians began expanding their eastern flank along the low-lying ground, occupying various new positions in the forest plantations. From there, they were able to break through Ukrainian positions in a southwesterly direction, advancing for around 3.9km to the next set of tactical heights, where they took up new positions in the treelines. They were also able to improve their positions along two parallel treelines on the heights south of Zelena Dolnya.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces continued to slowly advance in the village of Seredjne. They advanced from the centre of the village, reaching its southern outskirts. Additionally, once reinforcements were brought in, they began expanding their zone of control west of the settlement, capturing new treeline positions. \nAdditionally, Russian forces were confirmed to have withdrawn from the northern outskirts of Shandryholove after failing to consolidate. Ukrainian forces, on the other hand, withdrew from their positions north of Serednje, where a grey zone has formed. \n+ ~6.64km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
