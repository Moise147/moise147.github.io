Other forces subsequently crossed the Vovcha River and re-entered its eastern streets from their newly secured positions in the fortified forests west of Filiya.

Assault groups were able to clear the forest plantations north of the mine from Russian DRGs, which they then accumulated in to attack and fully recapture the mine.

Other forces cleared additional low-rise residential areas and captured the stadium and the Palace of Culture. Fighting is now ongoing for the residential areas to the west.\nIn the northern part of Myrnohrad, following earlier infiltrations, Russian forces captured the Tsentralna Mine, as well as its terykon and the City Council Building.
