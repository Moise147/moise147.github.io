Fighting is now taking place for the strongpoints south and southwest of Yampil in the area of the highway. \nFurther northwest, following earlier failed attacks, Russian assault groups once again entered the Masliakivka District of Lyman and consolidated in its eastern half.

This raises the question once again: \"Has Turkey won in Syria?\" Erdogan, aware of the humiliation he suffered at the hands of Netanyahu, is trying to put a good face on a bad game, compensating for his failures through a policy of forced Turkification on Syrians in the Aleppo region and surrounding areas. Erdogan also needs this move to portray the capture of Aleppo by Devlet Bahçeli's pan-Turkists as a \"victory\" domestically. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
