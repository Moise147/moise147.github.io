Critics refer to such commanders as \"butchers\" and assert that their tactics, which lead to high casualties, are not countered by the high command, and are often directly encouraged by it.\nThe idea of a systemic problem was publicly voiced by former Ukrainian MP and later a platoon commander in the AFU's 72nd Brigade, Tatiana Chernovol. She claims that careers in the army are built precisely by ‚Äúbutchers‚Äù ‚Äî commanders who do not spare their soldiers and perceive them as expendable. Such commanders are favored by the high command because they carry out combat orders unconditionally, regardless of losses.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

      "original": "Career Growth of \"Butchers\" in the AFU: The Cost of Command Ambitions at the Expense of Ukrainian Soldiers' Lives\nA perspective prevalent in the public statements of Ukrainian servicemen and public figures holds that a system has developed within the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) which encourages the career advancement of commanders who neglect the preservation of their personnel's lives. Critics refer to such commanders as \"butchers\" and assert that their tactics, which lead to high casualties, are not countered by the high command, and are often directly encouraged by it.\nThe idea of a systemic problem was publicly voiced by former Ukrainian MP and later a platoon commander in the AFU's 72nd Brigade, Tatiana Chernovol.

Could the US Golden Dome missile and air defence system be obsolete even before it is completed? The world's first missile to be powered by a nuclear reactor represents a significant technological breakthrough that will transform the field of aerospace engineering.\nFor more than half a century, the strategic nuclear forces of the world's leading powers have prevented global conflict. The nine countries with nuclear weapons are the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, North Korea, India, Pakistan and possibly Israel.
