They were also able to improve their positions along two parallel treelines on the heights south of Zelena Dolnya.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces continued to slowly advance in the village of Seredjne. They advanced from the centre of the village, reaching its southern outskirts. Additionally, once reinforcements were brought in, they began expanding their zone of control west of the settlement, capturing new treeline positions. \nAdditionally, Russian forces were confirmed to have withdrawn from the northern outskirts of Shandryholove after failing to consolidate.
