Three were hit by a drone strike after being caught in the forest along the way, and the two survivors attempted to make a run for the gas station but were hit by another drone when crossing the fields. \nSix soldiers ran south from the landing spot and split up as they approached the industrial zone. Four ran southwest into the forest towards the substation, but three were hit by a drone. The fourth soldier escaped back to the edge of the forest before also being hit by a drone while hiding under a tree. As for the other two soldiers from this group, they were able to enter the first building of the industrial zone and hid in a room on the ground floor. Three drones then flew in through the windows, with two striking them. \nSo, knowing all this info, it seems that all 11 soldiers were killed or wounded in these attacks. Evacuations of any survivors are unlikely due to their presence behind Russian lines, and they will likely be captured by Russian troops.",
