Further north, after entering Novouspenivske from the south, the Russians established full control over the village and its surrounding positions. Simultaneously, the Russians consolidated to the north in Nove and quickly captured the rest of the village. Before this, any remaining Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from the areas east of Nove and Novouspenivske to avoid being encircled.\nAs these two villages were being captured, Russian DRGs began infiltrated to the villages of Rivnopillya and Yablukove, engaging in clashes with Ukrainian units sent to the area to clear them out. Assault groups, taking advantage of the complicated situation for Ukraine, then broke through Ukrainian positions west of Nove by advancing southwest down the road for over 5.6 km, capturing positions in numerous different treelines. Some forces were able to enter and entrench in eastern Yablukove, while others advanced to the west towards Rivnopillya, capturing the eastern street of the settlement. \nFurther north, taking advantage of the local collapse of Ukrainian defences near Solodke, Russian forces advanced west from Uspenivka for over 4 km, capturing numerous new treelines on the tactical heights and levelling the frontline between the newly captured village of Solodke and the breakthroughs further south. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to advance around Zlahoda. They pushed south from the village to the next treelines, capturing them and entering the village of Rybne, which was quickly brought under control.

Other forces improved their positions along the treeline towards the eastern part of the mine. Heavy fighting continues on the approaches of this very important fortified node.\nWest of Pokrovsk, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences north of Kotlyne, capturing positions in the treelines to the north and northwest. They then went on to advance further northeast to the next treelines over on the tactical heights, while other forces pushed north from the railway line. Additionally, Russian forces captured numerous new treeline positions closer to Pokrovsk and made additional progress along the railway line to the south of Hryshyne, where they are beginning to outflank the Ukrainian positions in the rest of those treelines. \nIn northern Pokrovsk, under the cover of fog, additional Russian reinforcements were brought from the city centre to help the units who were struggling to consolidate in the northern residential areas of the 8th District. The remaining Ukrainian assault groups were forced to retreat from this part of the city, allowing for the Russians to establish full control over the district. Additionally, Russian forces advanced northwest from the low-rise part of the Dinas District to the nearby forested areas, while other forces in the 8th District advanced north to the forested areas just outside the city, forcing most Ukrainian formations to withdraw much further west - away from the Myrnohrad Pocket. \nIn northwestern Pokrovsk, after establishing control over and consolidating in the Shcherbakova District, Russian soldiers began infiltrating north across the Hryshinka River to the northernmost street of Pokrovsk and the Druzhba Dachas, where they are now trying to consolidate. Fighting is ongoing as Ukrainian forces attempt to prevent the Russians from securing this area as it would build a buffer outside the main part of the city and help develop the eastern flank to Hryshyne. \nNorth of Pokrovsk, Russian forces continued advancing down the road to Hryshyne and have captured additional positions there. They also advanced down a perpendicular treeline to the north. Assault groups then began attacking towards the next pig farm over, while DRGs infiltrated towards the third pig farm.

They also consolidated in a large trench fortification further north and are attacking east down a treeline to the other one. Additionally, the Russians began attacks north up a treeline from eastern Lysivka to the western part of Sukhyi Yar. \nIn southeastern Myrnohrad, Russian forces continued assault operations from the area of the terykon to residential areas in the area of Dymytrov Park.

This number is massive for such a short period of time and shows the profound level of crisis within the Ukrainian military. In fact, this is the highest number of desertions reported in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, which also indicates that more recently the conditions of the war have become increasingly intolerable...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
