The image shows just one Su-34 out in the open, and construction is still ongoing for additional hangars. \nThese hangars aim to prevent Ukrainian UAVs from damaging or destroying the aircraft stationed here, with similar construction efforts currently ongoing at several other airbases. Currently, aircraft which have dedicated hangars only leave them before takeoff, with all maintenance being carried out inside them. \nThe airbase's warehouse is also visible in the imagery, which stores KAB glide-bombs which are used daily by the Su-34s to strike frontline targets in Ukraine. \nImage credit: \nhttps://t.me/StrategicaviationT/17419",
