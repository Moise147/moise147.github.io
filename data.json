      "original": "Update from the Gaza Strip - Gaza Governorate (12/8/25):\nThe IDF began what appears to be the first stages of their offensive aimed at capturing all of Gaza City.\nIsraeli forces, reinforced with armoured units, began a push through the flattened parts of southern Gaza City, previously cleared during the early stages of the war while the Netzarim Corridor was being established. They were able to occupy a large section of this area, reaching the less-destroyed parts of the Zeitoun Neighbourhood of Gaza City from the south, where they began clearing the surrounding areas in preparation for the advance into the more \"dangerous\" urban areas. A forward command and control post was likely set up at the school at 31.48877, 34.44553.\nAdditionally, the IDF continued to slowly clear the Shujaiyya Neighbourhood of eastern Gaza City, clearing one of the last areas east of the Salah Al-Deen Highway here, effectively completing the main part of their buffer zone project from the border, which they began working on in early April of this year. Israeli soldiers are now operating beyond the highway at this section, but no major clearing operations have been recorded yet.\nPalestinian militants are in turn intensifying their attacks, with the Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) and the Saraya Al-Quds Brigades (PIJ) carrying out the majority of attacks. These are mainly comprised of remotely detonating IEDs, and firing projectiles at vehicles, although mortars and short-range rockets have also been employed. Other smaller factions such as the Mujahideen Brigades have also been carrying out attacks. \n@Arabosint\n recently estimated that around 4,800 fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades are present in Gaza City, down from the ~6,000-8,000 that were estimated to be part of Hamas' Gaza Brigade prior to October 7, 2023. Most of these fighters will have received much less training than your average pre-war militant, with many being recruited since the war began. However, these numbers provided by ArabOsint do not include that of other factions, such as the Saraya Al-Quds Brigades or the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.",
