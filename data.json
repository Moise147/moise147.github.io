They also improved their positions to the north, capturing new treeline positions and establishing control over a gulley from the south, now coming within 1.5 km of the southern outskirts of Novopavlivka.\nIn the east, Russian forces continued to clear areas near the Donetsk - Dnipropetrovsk Regional Border. They captured Ukrainian positions in the treelines on the tactical heights north of Novoukrainka, before crossing over the border into the treelines northeast of Dachne, further pressuring the Ukrainian formations in the area of the highway. \nTo the north, the Russians began retaking previously lost positions around Horikhove. They pushed west from the outskirts of Horikhove to the forested areas along the regional border and began clearing treelines on the tactical heights north of the village, crossing over into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast here too. \n+ ~23.68 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
