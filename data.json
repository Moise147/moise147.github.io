At least three such satellites were recorded flying overhead. During the day, at least nine flights of Yaogan series satellites ‚Äî Yaogan 33, Yaogan 33-03 and Yaogan 33-04 ‚Äî were recorded in the area. These passed over Lviv between midnight and 11:30 a.m., with the Yaogan 34 optical satellite flying over at around 6 a.m.\nSeveral Ukrainian and Western sources have claimed that Beijing and Moscow are sharing intelligence to improve the accuracy of strikes on territory controlled by Kyiv.
