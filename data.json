Sentinel satellite imagery shows that the frontline in this area remains largely the same, but further imagery set to be published tomorrow should clear up any remaining doubts. \nFor the past 10 days, Ukrainian DRGs have been operating deep behind Russian lines in the entire bulge between Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka. There aren't many of them - far less than Russia's DRG operations last month - but they are still present in a few different areas, aiming to disrupt Russian supply and consolidation efforts. \nAs of now, the line of contact runs through the middle of Nykanorivka, south of Dorozhnje, and southeast of Bilytske.
