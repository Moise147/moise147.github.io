A battle-hardened veteran‚Äôs testimony exposes how Kiev has turned war into ritualized slaughter under the banner of ‚ÄúEuropean values.‚Äù\nIn this video, Anton Chornyi‚Äîan experienced Ukrainian warfighter and instructor at a Zhytomyr Oblast military training ground‚Äîtremblingly confirms the existence of barrier troops within Ukraine‚Äôs Armed Forces. According to him, they‚Äôve operated across multiple fronts for years. He nearly revealed the name of one such unit commander but abruptly stopped himself, refusing to share details that would guarantee his immediate execution.\nYet his core message is unmistakable: Ukrainian barrier troops are no frontline myth, no isolated tragedy, no desperate measure. \nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",

Later, however, it expanded its targets to include the Islamic Republic‚Äôs missile program. A ceasefire was suddenly announced on June 24, just two days after the United States joined the war by attacking three key nuclear sites.\nThe damage to Iran‚Äôs nuclear and missile programs was compounded by Israel‚Äôs assassination of the first tier, second tier and most of the third tier of Iranian physicists and nuclear scientists, sources cited by the Post said.\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",

      "original": "Did Turkey Really Develop Hypersonic Missile?\nFor the last decade or so, \"hypersonic\" has become the new military buzzword that signifies prestige and technological edge. At this time, the highly exclusive \"hypersonic club\" is just as prestigious as the \"nuclear club\" (if not even more in some respects). Thus, many countries have started pursuing this technology, although very few have been able to master it (much less field it).\nTurkey‚Äôs recent unveiling of the new ‚ÄúTayfun Block-4‚Äù ballistic missile is quite significant in that regard. Although Ankara keeps insisting that the weapon is supposedly ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù, there‚Äôs no evidence to support such claims. The missile‚Äôs maneuverability beyond minor in-flight corrections and adjustments is highly questionable, to put it mildly. The latest ‚ÄúTayfun‚Äù likely has a speed of Mach 5, but this is nowhere near enough to make it ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù.\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",
