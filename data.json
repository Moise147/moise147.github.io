In response to Beijing’s decision to restrict the export of rare earth metals and magnets, US President Donald Trump has announced that he will introduce 100% tariffs on all products imported from China. He also said that the planned meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, was no longer necessary.\nThe two world superpowers are locked in a standoff. While it is currently only a trade war, the economy is the most important factor for a country’s stability in turbulent times.
