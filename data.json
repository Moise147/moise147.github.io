Ukraine still holds the agricultural complex west of the settlement. The Russians then went on to advance southwest through the treelines to northern Andriivka-Klevstove and entered the village from there, as well as from the east.  As a result, most of the village is either under Russian control or in the grey zone, while the highway running into was captured.",
