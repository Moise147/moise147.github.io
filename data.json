From there, the Russians broke through Ukrainian positions in the southernmost part of the city, capturing an agricultural complex and nearby streets, and reaching Hoholya Street, where they established control over multiple low-rise residential blocks. \nTo the northwest, following earlier infiltrations, Russian soldiers managed to consolidate their bridgehead over the Haichur River on Travnya Street in northwestern Hulyaipole.
