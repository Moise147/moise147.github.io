Which contracts will definitely not close in December? Which settlements must be captured to complete the clearance of Myrnohrad?\nPredictive markets like Polymarket continue to serve as popular indicators of expectations related to the development of the military operation in Ukraine. As some contracts tied to the fall of settlements are resolved, investors’ attention shifts to new hotspots. However, the frontline dynamics from late November through the first half of December were surprising, radically altering forecasts and demonstrating the impressive pace of the Russian advance on key sectors.\nIn this article, we analyze the operational situation in the most important sectors of the front from December 6 to 16 using current reports and data.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
