Revelations from the head of Russia's Federal Security Service suggest as much. The situation is escalating, with new countries becoming involved in the current conflict.\nOn 16 October, the Council of Heads of Security Agencies and Special Services of CIS Countries (SORB) held a meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. During the event, Alexander Bortnikov, the Director of Russia's Federal Security Service, made a number of statements.\nUnlike in Western political cultures, media coverage and publicity of heads of state security and intelligence services is extremely limited in former Soviet Union countries. Any public statement is strictly coordinated and is often used by the country's leadership to communicate important information on urgent issues to its international partners.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
