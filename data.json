Hours after the fall of the regime, the Israeli military occupied the buffer zone adjacent to the Golan Heights in southern Syria. It later went on to launch hundreds of strikes with the aim of destroying the country’s military capabilities.\nTensions mounted with Turkey, the main backer of the Syrian government, over these moves, especially when Israeli strikes hit bases where Ankara planned to deploy troops earlier this year.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

Otherwise, diplomacy could devolve into a continuation of the war by more sophisticated means. \nIn this scenario, Ukraine risks becoming a pawn in the great powers’ geopolitical game, and the principles of international law and state sovereignty could be sacrificed for short-term political interests and pragmatic calculations.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
