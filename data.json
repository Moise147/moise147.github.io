They repelled the most recent Ukrainian counterattacks north of the Haichur River which were aimed at expanding their bridgehead and began pushing back from the area of the agricultural buildings, eventually eliminating Ukraine's bridgehead altogether. \nFrom there, building on their momentum, Russian forces crossed the Haichur River into the western part of Hulyaipole, establishing a foothold on Travnya 1st street in the area of the school and the intersection with Michurina Street. The bridgehead was subsequently connected with the older bridgehead to the northwest, forming a solid front against Ukrainian defences in the western part of the city. \nThese attacks across the Haichur River were done in coordination with assault operations in the city centre. Russian forces advanced from their bridgehead in the area of the hospital complex and captured the local high school, the police station, and the district museum. Once these main strongpoints were taken, they pushed further northwest to Luhova Street and linked up with the larger bridgehead in the western part of the city. They also further expanded their zone of control in the city centre, capturing additional 3-story apartment buildings and the city's administrative building. Attacks are now underway on the western part of the city centre in the direction of the northeastern edge of the Ukrainian stronghold in the high-rise blocks. \nTo the south, Russian forces managed to eliminate the Ukrainian pocket in the eastern part of Hulyaipole. It's unclear how many soldiers managed to escape the operational encirclement. From there, they captured rest of the southern low-rise residential streets, while other forces managed to consolidate in at least 9 high-rise buildings of the main stronghold. Additionally, the earlier Ukrainian counterattacks west of the high-rise blocks were repelled, however Russian progress has significantly slowed here. \n+ ~4.12 km² in favour of Russia.",

Russian forces managed to consolidate in the remaining treelines and forested areas east of the Haichur and south of the Yanchur Rivers, which they used to accumulate in before crossing the Haichur River, infiltrating and quickly establishing control over the village of Pishchane.\nOther forces advanced west along the northern bank of the Yanchur River from the area of the Hulyaipole - Pokrovs'ke highway and captured the village of Ostapivske and the surrounding treelines. Other forces improved their positions southwest of Vidradne, capturing new treeline positions. From there, they pushed north from Ostapivske to the neighbouring village of Andriivka and consolidated in its southern streets. Assault operations were then carried out further north, allowing for the Russians to bring most of the settlement under their control. Fighting continues for the northern streets, which remain in the grey-zone.\nIn the south, following earlier infiltrations, Russian forces managed to consolidate in the treelines across the Haichur River west of Nove Zaporizhzhya. Other assault groups continued expanding their main bridgehead by advancing further north and linked up with this smaller bridgehead west of Nove Zaporizhzhya. \n+ ~24.33 km² in favour of Russia.",

A large grey-zone remains in part of southern Novopavlivka.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces began pushing the Ukrainians back from the fortifications south of Novopavlivka. They advanced from their positions east and west of the strongpoints north of the gulley, dislodging the Ukrainians from their positions there and beginning a push north towards the northern gulley. They were able to establish control over the forested areas there, while other forces consolidated in the treelines northeast of Filiya.\nIn the east, Russian forces advanced on a wide front northwest of Horikhove, pushing north up five parallel treelines and establishing control over the perpendicular treelines to the north. Other assault groups cleared the treelines northwest of Horikhove, further shrinking the Ukrainian salient east of Novopavlivka.\n+ ~18.60 km² in favour of Russia.",

They know Russia won't accept this; the same way Russia knows Ukraine won't accept their demands. It's all informational and is one of the reasons why I constantly say this war will be fought to its conclusion. \nRussia is the stronger side and is the side which is currently winning. Attritional warfare doesn't care about morals, your feelings, or what's \"right\" and \"wrong\". The stronger side wins and the weaker side loses. It might suck, and it might be a horrible thing to accept for many, but that's just the reality of how this works. \nIt either side is truly trying to achieve a lasting peace, any realistic agreements need to take into account the battlefield reality, not what either side \"deserves\" to have.
