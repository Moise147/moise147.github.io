They pushed north through the rest of Hlushchenkove, completing the capture of the village, and began propelling northwards towards Andriivka, threatening to cut off Azov in the salient to the east.

As a result of recent actions, this goal has been achieved, and the remaining road east of the river resupplying Shandryholove has been physically cut. \nRussian forces advanced from their newly captured positions on the tactical heights northeast of Derylove, as well as from the eastern outskirts of Shandryholove, to the forest plantations southeast of the village.

Other forces moved further west, capturing a small farm and gaining a foothold on the southern end of a forested area. Fighting is currently ongoing for the forests west of Myrne, where Ukrainian forces are surrounded on three sides.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces continued their assault on Zarichne, and managed to recapture the Torske Fish Farm after Ukrainian forces withdraw over the Zherebets River.

From there, attacks were made from Shakhove to the west and northwest, where positions in three separate forest plantations were recaptured. Ukrainian forces also re-established control over the western approaches to Toretske, as well as the treelines further west, after the Russians withdrew to shorten their line of contact. \nOn the western flank of the salient, Azov resumed their assault operations after a brief pause which occurred in part due to intensified Russian FAB glide-bomb strikes. Supported by forces east of Novyi Donbas, they advanced from the treelines west of Vilne into Nove Shakhove, recapturing the village.

The village quickly came under Russian control due to additional progress being made towards Ternove from the southeast. \nTo the northeast, after capturing Novoheorhiivka, Russian forces began their operation to capture Komyshuvakha. Ukraine had a much larger presence here, so Russia opted to encircle the settlement instead. They advanced north up the treelines on the tactical heights west of the village, and west from Shevchenko to the rear of Komyshuvakha, forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw to the northwest to avoid being cut off. \nAt the same time, Russian forces spearheaded west along the Vorona River, capturing the village of Vorone. Ukrainian forces counterattacked and managed to retake some positions there, but after back-and-forth fighting, Russia pushed them out once again and consolidated there. This was helped in part by the capture of the treelines on the heights southwest of Sichneve, improving their supply. Russian supply was already relatively unhindered as Ukrainian drone operators were caught off-guard in frontline settlements and had to take the time to redeploy and set up further in the rear, resulting in a significant decrease in Ukrainian FPV drone usage. \nTo the north, Russian forces were able to approach Sichneve from the east, before breaking through Ukrainian lines north of the village to the Vovcha River. They moved west down a gulley, capturing positions in the forest plantations, and entered the northern part of Novoselivka, although it's unclear if any positions have been established. They were also able to capture treeline positions on the heights north of the gulley used to enter Novoselivka.\nIn the north, Russian forces recaptured previously lost positions in the treelines east of Oleksandrohrad, forcing the Ukrainians to pull back into the village.\n+ ~42.76km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
