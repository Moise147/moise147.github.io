They pushed further west down Stritenska and Syerova Streets and entered the eastern houses of Razina Street.

Ukrainian forces resumed their assault operations towards the treelines south of Nykanorivka, attacking from their positions east of the railway line.\nIn the eastern part of the Kucheriv Yar salient, fierce fighting is ongoing for the Volodymyrivka - Shakhove area. After repelling Russian assaults on northern Volodymyrivka, and inflicting heavy casualties on the initial force dropped off by the earlier mechanised assault, Ukrainian forces began attacking south from the northern street with their newly accumulated infantry, and captured new residential areas in the northern part of the village.
