      "original": "Over the last week, I've seeing a lot of Pro-Ukraine accounts beginning to doom about the war. People are highlighting the massive issues plaguing the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the Russian superiority in all the different fields of war.\nBut I guarantee you, that at some point towards the end of 2025 and into 2026, Ukraine will carry out some sort of PR-related operation like Spiderweb or Kursk which will \"win back\" these supporters. And sure enough, they will follow like sheep and good lil' patriots, changing up the presumed narrative, and shifting the goal posts back, once again, to restoring the 2014, or even 1991 borders. \nWe saw a similar phenomenon last year. After Russia entered northern Kharkiv Oblast and attacked the cities of Vovchansk and Lyptsi, and Ukraine redeployed units away from the Donbas, Russia began rapidly advancing in the directions of Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, Ukrainsk, and Kurakhove. Pro-Ukrainians began sounding the alarms, with these rapid advances massively contrasting the prolonged and difficult battle for Avdiivka. Then, in early August, Ukraine launched their Kursk operation, and everything changed back. \nIt's just the ebb and flow of the uninformed parts of the information space. But slowly, the goal posts are shifting. It's not linear, but the goal posts are trending in favour of Russia, and away from the original goal which was set of restoring the 1991 borders. This will only accelerate, but of course with a delay to Russian progress as we have seen in the past.",

It is unlikely to be equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles, as another Tu-160 redeployed from Engels-2 Airbase to Ukrainka Airbase, suggesting a rotation was carried out for training purposes, as this bomber has been stationed at Engels-2 for a long time and was only ever used for training.\n2 Tu-95MS and 1 Tu-160 landed at Engels-2 Airbase just now after redeploying from Ukrainka airbase and will also be equipped with Kh-101 missiles. The 2 Tu-95MS will likely make a flight to Olenya Airbase, Murmansk Oblast, in the next 36 hours. \nAnother IL-76MD cargo plane, along with an An-26 cargo plane landed at Rostov Airbase. The cargo consists of additional Iskander-M ballistic missiles, which will be delivered to OTRK installations near Taganrog, Rostov Oblast. \nRemember, 2 Iskanders were launched from Taganrog last night at a target in Berestyn, Kharkiv Oblast. It's also possible (but unlikely in my opinion) that a portion of these Iskanders from Rostov Airbase are being delivered to OTRK installations at Millerovo Airbase, Rostov Oblast.\nNew deliveries of at least 150 Geran-2 drones have been made to the launch sites at Millerovo Airbase, Rostov Oblast, and Navlya Test Site, Bryansk Oblast, via rail. Accumulation of drones at launch points surrounding Ukraine that have been allocated for this upcoming attack will be over 400 now. \nOne \"Buyan-M\" Corvette was equipped with up to 8 Kalibr cruise missiles at Novorossiysk Naval Base, Krasnodar Krai. No other Kalibr carriers are known to be equipped with missiles, so if the upcoming attack occurs in the next two days, it's unlikely that Kalibrs will be used\nOne MiG-31K fighter carried out rare, long-range training from Savasleika Airbase, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. An IL-76M tanker from Diaghilev Airbase, Ryazan Oblast, took part in refueling the aircraft. \nCurrently, there are 8 MiG-31Ks stationed at Savasleika Airbase. Their equipment status is unknown, but likely only a portion are equipped with Kinzhal missiles. The 2 MiG-31Ks at Akhtubinsk Airbase, Astrakhan Oblast, are not equipped with missiles.\nRight now, there are 3 Tu-95MS at Olenya Airbase, 3 Tu-95MS at Engels-2 Airbase, and 5 Tu-160s at Engels-2 Airbase. Currently confirmed to be equipped / are being equipped with missiles are: 6 Tu-95MS and 3 Tu-160s. \nThe next large-scale missile attack is unlikely to take place tonight, but there is an increased threat for Wednesday night / Thursday morning, and the three nights after that.",
