      "original": "In the Dobropillya - Druzhkivka direction, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have advanced, making significant progress. \nUkrainian forces continued their attempts at cutting off the Russian salient to Kucheriv Yar. Prior to these attacks, Ukrainian forces regained control over Dorozhnje and the section of railway line to the south, sometime in the past two weeks. They also cleared the remaining Russian DRGs from the eastern approaches of Bilytske. Once they secured their position in the western part of Nykanorivka, Ukrainian forces pushed southwest and downhill through the treelines on the tactical heights to the western outskirts of Boikivka, where fighting is ongoing for a large trench fortification and nearby forests. \nOn the eastern flank of the salient, Ukrainian forces continued to slowly advance south down the eastern bank of the Kazenyi Torets River and gained a foothold in the northern houses of Novotoretske. They also pushed southeast down a gulley and recaptured the treelines on the heights to the north. West of the Kazenyi Torets River, the Ukrainians recaptured most of Pankivka, and began attacking west towards the Hektova Balka Gulley, supporting the flanking attacks further south. They were able to capture a forest and improve their positions along the treelines running west.\nIn the northern part of the Kucheriv Yar salient, Ukrainian forces continued to advance on Kucheriv Yar, and crossed the Hruzka River at a new point, capturing a U-shaped treeline and gaining a foothold at the southern part of the adjacent chalk quarry. Russian forces continued their assault operations in eastern Nove Shakhove. \nMeanwhile, further east, Russian forces began pushing back from the Popiv Yar area, recapturing previously lost positions in the forested areas north and west of the chalk quarries. The Ukrainians are attempting to counterattack here. \nTo the north, Russian forces significantly intensified their assault operations in the direction of Druzhkivka - possibly marking the beginning of a new offensive. Here, they advanced up both banks of the Poltavka River, capturing treeline positions on the heights to the west, as well as positions in the forests and treelines up to the gulley east of the river. Attacks are also once again underway towards the gulley leading to Sofiivka, although it's unclear how successful they were due to sentinel satellite imagery being completely obscured with clouds. \n+ ~28.14 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine. \n+ ~14.00 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
