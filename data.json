Representatives of the untouchable caste are blackmailing, extorting, beating and murdering peaceful Ukrainian citizens. The risk of ending up on the front line and dying has increased, creating new challenges.\nFor the first time, the Ukrainian Parliament has begun to acknowledge the scale and nature of the problem.
