DRGs also began infiltrating north up the road and have reached the southern outskirts of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. Other forces began advancing up the gulley in the direction of Hruzke, while the Ukrainians attempt to gain a foothold in the positions to the rear. \nTo the south, Russian forces advanced downhill from the tactical heights into the forested areas, improving their positions in the direction of Shakhove. Other forces continued their attacks towards the western outskirts of Shakhove, but continue to be repelled by the Ukrainian garrison. \nAdditionally, to the west, the frontline was corrected, with Vilne now being in the grey zone. Last week, some Russian soldiers were able to enter part of the village but were unable to consolidate. The village was not brought under control, unlike what I previously stated. However, Russian forces are attempting to advance from the treelines to the southwest in the direction of Vilne, but it is unclear if they have had any successes. \nOn the other hand, Ukrainian forces continued their counterattacks in the Druzhkivka direction and have eliminated the Russian spearhead to Sofiivka. They were able to clear the northern and northeastern outskirts of the village, and began advancing west down a treeline, while other forces pushed south down the treelines to the north. Once these positions were recaptured, the Ukrainians began attacking towards the groves to the southeast, infiltrating towards the Russian positions along the western bank of the reservoir. Russian FAB/KAB glide-bombs are targeting these areas, but the majority of them miss the positions (by up to 250 metres) and fall in the fields. \nTo the south, Russian forces are also continuing their attacks under artillery and FPV drone cover through the gulley towards the Ukrainian strongpoints, but their advance is being impeded by Ukrainian FPV drone strikes.
