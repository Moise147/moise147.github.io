      "original": "In the Dobropillya direction, and on the northeastern flank of Pokrovsk, Russian forces intensified their assault operations and have made major progress over the past 10 days.\nIn the northeast, at the beginning of October, Russian forces began a concerted effort to regain control over the tactical heights southeast of Volodymyrivka which Ukrainian forces recaptured last month. They began advancing northwest up a gulley and towards the southern bank of the Staryy Reservoir, capturing the treelines between them. These advances, alongside the clearing of the northern street of Novotoretske, forced the AFU to fully withdraw back into Volodymyrivka. \nAt the same time, Russian forces were able to push the Ukrainians back from their forward positions on the western approaches to Poltavka, clearing the northernmost chalk quarry and surrounding positions. They then began attacks through the treelines and forest plantations to the eastern bank of the Staryy Reservoir. \nWith these attacks now complete, under the cover of the fog and rain, two large Russian mechanised columns involving tanks and armoured personnel carriers advanced on Volodymyrivka. The first moved in from the south, advancing up the road and reaching the southern edge of the village. A portion of the vehicles were hit and disabled by Ukrainian FPV drones, however more than 50 Russian soldiers were able to dismount and scatter among the southern part of Volodymyrivka. With the remaining vehicles being able to retreat, these Russian soldiers began clearing the rest of the settlement and captured its central part. The rest of the village is now either in the grey zone, or under Russian control. \nThe second mechanised column advanced down the road from Poltavka towards the rear of Volodymrivka. While more of the vehicles in this column were hit and disabled (with many being hit before reaching the frontline), a number of Russian soldiers were able to dismount and establish control over the forest plantations east of Volodymyrivka, effectively pushing the AFU back into the stronghold village of Shakhove.\nMeanwhile, west of the Kazenyi Torets River, Russian forces were able to consolidate in the southern and central parts of Pankivka, pushing the Ukrainians back into Shakhove. They also improved their positions along the forest plantations towards Shakhove from the west.\nTo the southwest, Russian forces were able to break out of northern Zatyshok, where they established control over the treelines north of the village which were previously in the grey zone. They also re-established control over the central part of Boikivka, as well as the forest plantations and trench fortifications to the west. Additionally, the Russians launched a series of counterattacks from eastern Nykanorivka, recapturing previously lost positions in the northwest of the village, before eventually fully pushing the AFU out of the settlement. With this, Russia was able to eliminate the salient to Boikivka, and have now secured their Kucheriv Yar salient against any Ukrainian encirclement attempts. \nIn the south, Russian forces continued their attacks towards the city of Myrnohrad from the east. They consolidated their positions in the southern part of Novoekonomichne, and began advancing through the forests and treelines towards the village of Balahan. Russian soldiers have entered Balahan, although no consolidation is confirmed yet. Russian infantry was also able to advance from positions west of Mykhailivka, infiltrating and capturing a trench strongpoint and mine shaft no. 2 of the Kapitalna Mine.\n+ ~59.23 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
