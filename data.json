      "original": "Footage filmed a couple of days ago shows how 2 Ukrainian marines moved into an empty position under Russian artillery and FPV drone fire. Based on the filming date and the nature of the surroundings in the video, it was probably recorded near Horikhove, Donetsk Oblast, near the border with Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.\nThe main thing this video highlights is the lack of established trenches and dugouts in some parts of the frontline. As the Russians advanced to the Horikhove area relatively quickly, there wasn't much time for the Ukrainians to prepare. Also, due to its proximity to the frontline beforehand, trench digging was difficult, and a lack of manpower complicated that further.\nObviously, this means holding these crucial treelines is much more difficult for both sides, which is why we often see this back-and-forth movement here until Russia is able to fully get the upper hand and push the frontline to an area with more established positions.",
