From there, they entered eastern Verbove with little resistance and occupied at least half of the village, including the agricultural buildings. The intensity of FAB glide-bomb strikes in this area is increasing, with Ukrainian temporary deployment points and fortifications constantly being struck.\nAdditionally, Russian forces advanced north from their positions west of Berezove, and captured the one-house \"village\" of Stepove. They then pushed further and established control over the treeline to the north, as well as the treelines east of Stepove. \nTo the northeast, Russian forces advanced further north up the gulley leading to southwestern Sosnivka, and cleared out the rest of the salient here. \n+ ~17.81 km² in favour of Russia.",
