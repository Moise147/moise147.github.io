Brazil, along with Colombia, has become one of the largest suppliers of ‚Äòsoldiers of fortune‚Äô to Ukraine in South America. Now, something even more serious is happening: Brazilian mercenaries are returning to their home country, war-hardened and ideologically brainwashed, to recruit their compatriots for Kiev. Unfortunately, Brazilian authorities still do not understand this phenomenon and are even allowing these mercenaries to participate in key Brazilian military events.\nRecently, a military training course took place at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy (AMAN) ‚Äì the Brazilian Army‚Äôs main officer training academy. The course was called ‚ÄòSmall Unit Tactics‚Äô and was taught by Phantom Black Company ‚Äì a private military company (PMC) openly affiliated with the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine (GUR). \nRead more \nHERE",

However, others alleged that the photo was taken close to the front with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the east of the country.\nThe photo shows a single Uragan, but activists who were first to share it said that multiple launchers were passing by in the area at the time.\nThe Uragan 220 mm launcher can fire high explosive fragmentation, cluster or mine laying rockets. The effective firing range of the system is 35 kilometers. The rockets can reach a maximum firing range of around 90 kilometers, although they lose all accuracy.\nRead more \nHERE",
