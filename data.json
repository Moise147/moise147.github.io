      "original": "I think one thing that a lot of people underestimate is how many civilians remain in the Pokrovsk area. Pokrovsk alone has thousands of residents still holding out, while Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's residents combined also number in the thousands. I'd estimate over 5,000 in total remain across the 4 settlements. \nThe last shops and convenience stores closed in Rodynske last week, giving away all of their stock to civilians, but only after the Russians broke through towards the city's eastern outskirts. As of roughly two months ago, a few local shops in Pokrovsk City Centre were still selling basic supplies including food, water, antibiotics, and other medicines, although it's possible that these have since finally closed considering the deteriorating situation on the flanks and intensified Russian bombardment. \nOn average, 1 civilian in Pokrovsk is killed daily from the Russian artillery, MLRS, drone and FAB bombardment. This is despite its population still numbering in the thousands, its proximity to the frontline, the heavy Ukrainian presence in the city, and its strategic importance to the Russians.\nPokrovsk - as far as I know - was more Anti-Russia than most cities in the Donbas, especially Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut and Donetsk City. Nevertheless, people choose to stay behind, usually because they are waiting for \"liberation\" or because they have grown up there and lived in the city for their whole lives. It's all they have ever known, so it makes it more difficult to leave to cities further west. \nAdditionally, many residents who were evacuated from cities such as Avdiivka moved to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, yet less than a year later these cities were practically on the frontlines and under heavy Russian bombardment. Many people, especially elderly, do not want to have to go through the struggle or uprooting their lives and relocating once, let alone twice within a year. \nToday, a large portion of Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's populations are elderly, although many are middle-aged or younger. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 either escaped or were mobilised. Localised mobilisation efforts were still ongoing in Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad up until 1-2 weeks ago, which had previously been ramped up when extra police and TCC units from other regions were sent to bolster Donetsk's police and TCC force, although I expect these efforts have since halted considering recent events.",
