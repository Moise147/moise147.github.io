      "original": "Russia Ramps Up Drone Production Amid NATO No-Fly Zone Plans And Starlink Disruptions\nThe strikes on September 14‚Äì15 were relatively low: Russian air defenses shot down six Ukrainian drones overnight and four in daylight, mostly in Belgorod. Russia launched 84 Geran/Herbera drones and three missiles, with 59 drones downed. A significant factor was the disruption of Starlink system operations along the entire front line, which Ukrainian military personnel complained about.\nMeanwhile, international observers note a significant increase in the production of Russian attack drones: according to The New York Times, Russia is currently capable of producing approximately 30,000 attack drones per year, and the total number of Russian drones launched against Ukraine in 2025 has reached 34,000. These drones feature improved guidance systems, enhanced resistance to electronic warfare, and new types of munitions. Russia employs drones in group waves, plotting complex routes...\nRead more \nHERE",
