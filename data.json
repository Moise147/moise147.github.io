They also reached the nearby orchards and captured positions in the adjacent treeline. \nTo the south, Russian forces crossed the gulley from Serednje, and captured the small forest and nearby treelines there. From here, they crossed the Nitrius River to the eastern bank, capturing the northern part of Shandryholove. This, plus advances from the north and east allowed for the Russians to establish control over the local school which previously served as Ukraine's main defensive node. Other forces who crossed over the river from southern Shandryholove then helped clear the rest of the village. \nA few hours later, Ukrainian forces re-infiltrated the western part of the village, and after a series of clashes, were pushed back across the river. Additionally, after a series of attempts, Russian forces secured a bridgehead on the western bank of the Nitrius river southwest of Shandryholove, and captured the agricultural complex and nearby treelines.\nIn the south, Russian forces continued their assault on Derylove. They were able to marginally advance down the road west of the village, allowing for the western houses to be captured. They also secured the rest of the forested areas north of the gulley that runs along the northern edge of the settlement.\n+ ~10.96 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They are also continuing to bypass the clearings southwest of Torske and are continuing to infiltrate the northern streets of Yampil near the railway station.\nIn eastern Yampil, Russian forces were finally able to consolidate after attacks were carried out from the forest to the east and the area of the Ostrich Farm to the northeast. Fighting is now ongoing for the rest of the eastern streets and the centre of the village, which are mostly in the grey zone. \nTo the east, Russian forces advanced from the area of the Sererbryanskyi Forest, securing new positions in the forests on the Donetsk side of the regional border.

The reason for the operation is still unknown as Wagner withdrew its open support of RSF in 2021 to provide Moscow the opportunity to establish ties with the Iran-backed Sudanese government.\nThe area of Wagner's operation are also critical to RSF, in that a large volume of military aid flows from UAE cargo planes landing at Birao Air Port, CAR (at \n10.23706, 22.71983\n), and then using route RN8 to enter Sudanese territory.
