The Pokrovsk urban agglomeration is still one of the most fiercely contested battlefields. The nature of the fighting, characterized by Russian tactics employing small assault groups in a strategy of ‚Äútotal infiltration‚Äù deep into Ukrainian defensive positions, has made it difficult to delineate clear front lines or zones of control. This ambiguity is actively exploited by Kyiv‚Äôs propaganda units, which frequently announce media victories that often bear little resemblance to the situation on the ground.
