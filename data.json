Russian forces are gradually advancing through the forests, seizing positions one after another, and have managed to enter the outskirts of Prylipka from the east. They also made additional incremental advances northwest of the village of Lyman, while other forces were able to enter the residential part of Synelnykove.\nTo the east, Russian forces continued pushing through southern Vovchansk and have advanced from the three-story buildings to the small industrial zone on the southern edge of the city, capturing most of it. They also continued pushing east through the low-rise residential areas, where they reached the highway and destroyed bridge over the Vovcha River, and advanced beyond the highway into the denser residential areas of southern Vovchansk.\nAs a result of these Russian advances, the remaining Ukrainian units stationed in northern Vovchansk withdrew behind the river to prevent being cut off from the rear, officially ending the 18-month-long battles for this part of the city. The withdrawals took place from two small salients of flattened houses in the southeast and east. \nFurther east, over the past ten days Russian forces have been slowly pushing through the forests east of Tykhe, expanding a buffer zone around the newly recaptured village. They advanced further through the large forest in the north and captured treeline positions to the south. They also established control over some outlying houses of Vovchanski Khutory on the northern bank of the Vovcha River, as well as a nearby forest.\n+ ~5.97 km² in favour of Russia.",

Both sides are burning each other's positions to the ground and reducing buildings to rubble in order to win this battle, which is by far the most intense fighting for Rodynske so far.\nDespite some earlier Russian progress against this fortified area, Ukrainian forces have since managed to push back, with some positions changing hands multiple times. Russian FAB glide-bombs are striking Ukrainian forward deployment points west of the city, while Ukrainian FPV drones, artillery, and glide-bombs continue to cover Russian positions within Rodynske. \nThe nature of this fighting makes me suspect elite Ukrainian unit(s) are involved in this battle, but this is just a gut feeling for me as there is no evidence to back this up yet. \nIt seems Ukraine has tried to break through Russian lines here and force them to withdraw from their pincer northwest of Myrnohrad in order to relieve the encircled Ukrainian units, but have since been bogged down due to fierce Russian resistance, while the Russians are taking no chances and are trying to expel them from the city once again.",
