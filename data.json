Since January 20, 2025, there have been no tangible developments in the war, except for the ongoing offensive by the Russian Armed Forces across the entire front line. Yet, the assessment of Trump's strategy as unsuccessful is superficial.\nIn fact, the White House seems to have long since decided to withdraw the United States from a completely hopeless conflict. And all the steps taken by the Republican administration are aimed at creating the necessary backdrop. First and foremost, the US president is interested in the information backdrop.
