But Ukraine has become increasingly reliant on drones, often spreading infantry very thin across lines, creating a disorganised and often incoherent ground defence. Myrnohrad is an example of this, and there are a lot of nearby settlements that are good for concentrations of drone operators. \nAdditionally, many Ukrainian soldiers actually escaped this pocket back when it was still a salient. This is what allowed for Russia to penetrate deeper into the northern and southern parts of the city. \nFor an area of its size, with a significantly reduced garrison, I estimate that there are anywhere between 300 and 700 Ukrainian soldiers currently trapped there. It's impossible to know how many right now, but with the state the war is in today and other patterns observed from this front, it will be less than many people expect.",
