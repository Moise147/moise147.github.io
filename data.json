They advanced into and quickly captured Zatyshok, before immediately pushing southwest to Sukhetske which was also captured. Other positions in the surrounding areas were seized, and a general push to the railway line was made, resulting in a ~2.7km long section of it and the trench lines running parallel to it coming under Russian control.\nRussian DRGs then began moving into northern Rodynske, carrying out operations in both the dachas and the northern residential areas. As a result northern Rodynske is currently in the grey zone. Additionally, by exploiting a gap in the trench lines, Russian forces began advancing towards the train station, although it's unclear if they achieved any success. \nTo the north, the Russian were able to complete the capture of Nykanorivka by pushing outwards from their foothold in the southern houses, and from the newly captured positions in the forests to the east. They then went on to establish control over the forests west and north of the village, and began attacking the freight train station at Dorozhnje. DRGs have already begun infiltrating the city of Bilytske from the east\nAdditionally, Russian forces cleared the rest of the salient west of Razine, recapturing the treeline positions there, and entered the eastern part of Chervonyi Lyman. \n+ ~26.40km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

Additionally, construction work can be seen at the destroyed hypermarket next to the airport, although it's unclear if this is military related or just for restoration purposes. \nSome are saying that these new actions are to transform the destroyed airport into a Geran-2 drone launch point, although it is known that launches of Gerans have been taking place from a training ground near Donetsk City for the past two weeks already, although this will be further east than the airport. \nDonetsk International Airport was the epicentre of battles in 2014-2015 (where is sustained almost all of its damage) and remained on the frontline until the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024. At the closest point, it is roughly 35km away from the frontline. \nImage credit: \nt.me/MiliTJournal/28924",
