The auto-repair shop at 47.82259, 35.14838 was hit, along with the Motor Sich Plant in multiple places. However, electronic warfare seems to be affecting the accuracy of these bombs, as one that intended to hit the auto-repair shop missed by around 40 metres, and another aimed at the Motor Sich plant hit houses around 60 metres away across the street (47.83129, 35.19627).",

      "original": "In the Lyman direction, Russian forces continue to advance and have captured the village of Shandryholove.\nRussian forces advaced in three areas. In the north, they continued to improve their positions north of Serednje, capturing positions in the grey zone and securing their logistics into the village from the north. They also reached the nearby orchards and captured positions in the adjacent treeline. \nTo the south, Russian forces crossed the gulley from Serednje, and captured the small forest and nearby treelines there. From here, they crossed the Nitrius River to the eastern bank, capturing the northern part of Shandryholove. This, plus advances from the north and east allowed for the Russians to establish control over the local school which previously served as Ukraine's main defensive node. Other forces who crossed over the river from southern Shandryholove then helped clear the rest of the village. \nA few hours later, Ukrainian forces re-infiltrated the western part of the village, and after a series of clashes, were pushed back across the river. Additionally, after a series of attempts, Russian forces secured a bridgehead on the western bank of the Nitrius river southwest of Shandryholove, and captured the agricultural complex and nearby treelines.\nIn the south, Russian forces continued their assault on Derylove. They were able to marginally advance down the road west of the village, allowing for the western houses to be captured. They also secured the rest of the forested areas north of the gulley that runs along the northern edge of the settlement.\n+ ~10.96 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
