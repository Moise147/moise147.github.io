A strong push is also being made from Poltavka.\nAs for the Russian soldiers who were encircled last week, I wanted to wait a little to confirm this, but roughly 20 POWs were taken, around 15 of which surrendered near the small road north of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. The other ~5 were caught in the forests to the southeast.

      "original": "In the Pokrovske direction, over the past week and a half, Russian forces have been continuing to make significant progress in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk Oblasts.\nIn the south, Russian forces began assault operations in a section of the front that has remained largely quiet for years. They pushed west from the area of Levadne, and advanced down several treelines on the tactical heights, as well as down the northern bank of the Solona River in the direction of Olhivske. \nTo the north, they expanded their wedge in Zaporizhzhia Oblast from Novodarivka, pushing southwest and uphill to the tactical heights, as well as west - further down the forest plantations in the low-lying ground. They also improved their positions on the tactical heights to the north, by attacking southwest from the Temyrivka - Zelene Pole road.\nFurther north, after capturing Temryivka, Russian forces advanced uphill and northwest towards Zaporizke, capturing new treeline positions and approaching its outskirts from two directions. They also spearheaded north along the Dnipropetrovsk side of the regional border to Novoheorhiivka, quickly establishing control over the village and forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the adjacent positions. \nAdvances were also made between the Vorona River and a tributary of the Vorona River in Donetsk Oblast, where they were able to push downhill towards Komyshuvakha, while further improving their positions southwest and west of Shevchenko. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to bypass the rest of Maliivka from the north, moving along the heights, and capturing the agricultural buildings as well as the western part of the village, reaching the low-lying ground south of Sichneve. \n+ ~54.9km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They were able to clear the eastern bank of the Vovcha River south of Andriivka-Klevtsove of a Russian presence and began advancing towards Piddubne. \nThey were able to make a deep 6.5km penetration through Russian lines along the highway and turned north to clear the orchards and surrounding treelines. From there, Ukrainian forces entered western Tolstoi and established control over part of the village. Additional forces were also able to secure their rear, capturing numerous treeline positions southwest and south of Zelenyi Hai.\nAdditionally, after the Russians failed to capture the positions along the southern bank of the Vovcha River south of Ivanivka, Ukrainian forces began attacking southwest towards Zelenyi Hai. After fierce back-and-forth fighting, they were able to seize the agricultural buildings and surrounding treelines on the outskirts of Zelenyi Hai, before entering and capturing the northern part of the settlement. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces advanced north from the Yalta - Novokhatske Line, reaching the southern bank of the Vovcha River and taking up new positions in the forest plantations there. \n+ ~32.10km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~4.23km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

After entrenching in positions there, attempts were made to further expand their zone of control to the centre of the village. It's unclear if these succeeded, however the grey zone has expanded. \nRussian forces continued their slow, grinding advance through Udachne. They were able to capture new positions in the town centre, north of the railway line, which was previously turned into a kill-zone by Ukraine to prevent the Russians from reaching their remaining positions in the area of the school in the northwestern part of the town. \n+ ~0.95km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.47km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
