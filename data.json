      "original": "Reflections:\nA year ago, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (along with several civilians), dealing a brutal blow to the organisation after several setbacks in military and intelligence operations.\nThe Syrian resistance commemorated the anniversary of his martyrdom, emphasising Hezbollah's work in its fight against the Zionist entity over the years, highlighting Israel's defeat in southern Lebanon at the beginning of the 20th century.\nNasrallah's death marked a turning point in the power of Hezbollah and Iran in Lebanon. A few months later, the fall of the previous Syrian political regime made this setback even more visible. Hezbollah is currently undergoing a process of reconstruction, facing external and internal pressures to the point of displaying a passive attitude towards the Syrian terrorist authorities, something that would have been unthinkable ten years ago.\nThe Syrian resistance is now seeking to take over from Hezbollah as the main opposition to the state of Israel in the Levant, emphasising solidarity with the Palestinian cause and normalisation with Jolani, who has been Syria's main enemy in recent decades.\nHowever, I believe that this position is neither correct nor favourable for a successful movement in Syria. The regional situation has changed completely. December 2024 marked the end of any Arab nationalist project and the Arab League's complete passivity towards Israel prevailed, leaving Iran as the as the only state opposing Tel Aviv. The tragic events we have witnessed in Syria in recent months have completely fractured Syrian society along identity lines, leading to the proliferation of self-determination movements on the coast & Suwayda (concretely here when under the previous political regime the Druze sought only more autonomy) with the aim of freeing themselves from the yoke of those who seek to eradicate them on sectarian grounds.\nThe only solution that could solve the problem (if there is a solution) is the creation of a Syrian (not Arab) civic nationalist movement capable of uniting the different confessions under a single identity. The priority of the Syrian resistance should be to continue liberating the country from terrorist groups and not to embark on external ventures such as Palestine, whose future unfortunately seems doomed.\nIn other words, the Syrian resistance should take as its model the liberation of southern Lebanon in 2000 & the liberation of Mount Hermon in 1973 & not the liberation of al-Quds nor the creation of a new Sunni of Shia axis. Nothing beyond Lake Tiberias should be a priority.",

      "original": "The White Houe has released the U.S. peace plan for Gaza. Netanyahu has agreed to this plan, and Hamas has stated that they are looking over it. \nThe plan includes the following main points:\n1: Gaza will be a \"terror-free\" zone, meaning that militants from Hamas, and organisations fighting alongside Hamas such as the PIJ, PFLP, DFLP, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, etc, would have to leave the strip.\n2. Gaza will be \"redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza\". \n3. The war will immediately end in all sectors, including artillery and air bombardment. IDF forces will withdraw to the yellow line shown on the map. (Please note that the current control line shown on Trump's map is completely wrong). A staged withdrawal will begin once conditions are met. \n4. 72 hours later, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be handed over to Israel.\n5. After the hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners, as well as 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th, 2023, including all women and children. Additionally, for every Israeli hostage whose body is released, Israel will release the bodies of 15 deceases Gazans. \n6. After the hostage exchanges, all Hamas members who commit to \"peaceful co-existence\" and to decommission their weapons will be allowed safe passage out of the Gaza Strip to receiving countries. It is unknown if this will include members from other, Hamas-aligned organisations in Gaza. \n7. Full aid will then be sent to the Gaza Strip without interference, through the UN and its agencies, the red crescent, and other international institutions not associated with either party. The Rafah Border Crossing will also be opened, which the map below shows would be under IDF occupation.\n8. Gaza will be governed under a temporary, transitional government. It will be made up of \"qualified Palestinians\" and international experts and supervised by a new international transitional body headed by Trump. \n9. The Palestinian Authority will undergo a reform program. Once it has completed this, it will regain control over the Gaza Strip.\n10. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, but those who wish to can move to and from the strip.\n11. All military-related infrastructure in the Gaza Strip will be demolished and not rebuilt. \n12. The UN will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy to Gaza. It will train and provide support to Palestinian police forces in Gaza, as well as help secure Gaza's borders. \n13. The IDF will remain in the small perimeter zone shown on the map until Gaza is properly secured from any resurgence. \n14. An \"interfaith dialogue\" process will be established to change the mindsets of Palestinians and Israelis towards peace and co-existence. \n15. While Gaza is redeveloping and the PA is carrying out its reform program, there is a possibility for the recognition of a Palestinian state.",
