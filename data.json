After the Russians broke into Volodymyrivka, Ukraine resorted to covering almost the entire village with FPV drones and artillery, striking anything that moves, which resulted in much of the initial Russian assault groups being killed or wounded. Additional reinforcements have managed to enter the village, and new attacks are now underway towards the northern streets. Ukrainian forces currently control a single street in the north of the village, which is constantly being hit by Russian FPV drones.
