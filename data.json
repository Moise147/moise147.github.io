      "original": "Because Udachne is confirmed to be under Russian control, I think I should mention that according to my information, as of a few days ago, Ukraine is still \"unofficially\" extracting coal from the Pokrovsk Coal mine, north of Udachne. At that time the mine was approximately 1 km from the frontline. Now it is around 500 metres away. \nThe same is happening at the mine in Bilozerske, around 9 km from the frontline. You may remember that Russian DRGs were operating on the outskirts of Bilozerske during the Zolotyi Kolodyaz breakthrough earlier this month. \nThis appears to be from some sort of unofficial agreement between the two militaries regarding specific mines, although any details are currently unknown.",
