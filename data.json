A strong push is also being made from Poltavka.\nAs for the Russian soldiers who were encircled last week, I wanted to wait a little to confirm this, but roughly 20 POWs were taken, around 15 of which surrendered near the small road north of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. The other ~5 were caught in the forests to the southeast. Everyone else was either killed or managed to escape back to the Kucheriv Yar area.\nRussia has now regained the initiative in the Dobropillya direction and is making significant progress.
