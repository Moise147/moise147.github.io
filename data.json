In the east, Russian forces resumed their attacks in Luhansk Oblast, advancing north along the tactical heights towards the Kharkiv-Luhansk regional border. They moved along a treeline and a chain of forests, establishing control over previously lost positions there. From there, they advanced downhill and east to the outskirts of Hrekivka, recapturing the positions in the low-lying ground there. The Russians were also able to recapture the western edge of the forest towards the swamp on the Kharkiv-Luhansk-Donetsk tri-border point.\nIn the west, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions west of the Nitrius River, significantly expanding their small bridgehead on its western bank. They pushed north through the rest of Hlushchenkove, completing the capture of the village, and began propelling northwards towards Andriivka, threatening to cut off Azov in the salient to the east. Russian forces also advanced west to the tactical heights, seizing new treeline positions and pushing towards the village of Maliivka.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations in Novomykhailivka and Ridkodub, without making any confirmed progress. \n+ ~14.27km² in favour of Russia.",

As a result of recent actions, this goal has been achieved, and the remaining road east of the river resupplying Shandryholove has been physically cut. \nRussian forces advanced from their newly captured positions on the tactical heights northeast of Derylove, as well as from the eastern outskirts of Shandryholove, to the forest plantations southeast of the village. They continued to bypass it, moving further west to the next set of forest plantations, before reaching and cutting the road, and entrenching on the eastern bank of the Nitrius River. \nAs a result, Shandryholove has now been taken into an operational encirclement, as there are no bridges connecting the Ukrainian salient to the western bank of the river. We will likely see attempts be carried out by Ukrainian forces to unblock the road in the near future. \n+ ~4.56 km² in favour of Russia.",
