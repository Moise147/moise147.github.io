This, along with some information from other sources allows for us to paint a clearer picture of the events that unfolded here over the past 10 days. \nThey report that 50% of the Ukrainian soldiers defending the area of Uspenivka were withdrawn to improve the deteriorating situation near Vyshneve. At the time, Russia had quickly captured this relatively large village, crossed two rivers, and were advancing well beyond it to the north and west. These reinforcements somewhat stabilised the situation there, but it left a large gap in the defence of the Uspenivka area.\nAs a result, at least 200 Russian soldiers from the 14th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade, 218th Tank Regiment, and the 394th Motorized Rifle Brigade were able to enter Uspenivka, and bring it under their control relatively quickly. The 394th brigade consolidated in the village while the 14th brigade and 218th regiment began pushing to the nearby villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, Solodke, and Rivnopillya. \nIn order to try save the situation, one unspecified battalion of Ukraine's 102nd Territorial Defence Brigade was deployed to Uspenivka, but suffered heavy casualties due to Russia having already brought in significant reinforcements to the village, and just because of the fact that the battalion was low on manpower. \nA severe lack of coordination in cohesion in this sector, along with commanders not accurately reporting the situation to headquarters or neighbouring units, is partially responsible for these rapid losses in ground that should have been able to hold for some time. Critical manpower shortages also play a major role in this. These levels of incompetence, shortages, and inability to coordinate properly are beyond anything I have ever seen for Ukraine so far. \nAs a result of this chain of events over the past 10 days, Russia has been able to fully compromise Ukrainian defences on the western bank of the Yanchur River and is now pushing through the fields further west. Fighting is ongoing for the villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, and Rivnopillya, while Solodke was captured a few days ago. Rybne is also under threat of being encircled due to Russian advances near Zlahoda and Solodke, and all the while, the newly reinforced front further north is still not stabilised.",
