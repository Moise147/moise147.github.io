They then crossed the river to the south, capturing treeline positions on the opposite tactical heights, while other forces began pushing to the southwest. The Russians then secured the rest of the positions north of Zatyshshya, began pushing to the northwest of the village, and captured its northern street. Assault groups from the southern bank of the Kalmychka River then entered the southern street of the village from the east, quickly establishing control over it and a section of the road to the south.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces made additional progress along the tactical heights northeast of Hulyaipole, fleshing out the spearhead towards Varvarivka. They secured the agricultural buildings northwest of Zatyshshya and the treelines to the north, before crossing the Velyka Novosilka - Hulyaipole Road, and entering three parallel treelines to the west. Other assault groups secured the rest of the positions north of the gulley west of Yablukove, and advanced southwest and uphill to the other treelines west of the Velyka Novosilka - Hulyaipole Road. \nTo the north, Russian forces continued taking positions in the direction of the Hulyaipole - Pokrovsk'e Road and captured new positions in three separate treelines north of the initial breakthrough to the reservoirs.

They advanced east from their positions south of Ostapivske, entering the western part of Danylivka.

      "original": "Regarding the situation in Siversk:\nRecently, there have been a lot of differing claims from various sources about the situation in this critical city. Some are claiming that Russia has broken through and captured large parts of the city, while others say the situation is under control for Ukraine. Based on the information I have gathered, I can come to a somewhat conclusive position on what the true situation is here.\nFirstly, one major correction was made to the map. It turns out that previous Russian attempts to seize a series of Ukrainian strongpoints southeast of Siversk in September and October failed, with Ukrainian forces retaining control over important positions on the tactical heights there. The Russians instead opted to bypass these areas, advancing along the railway line and from the area of Verkhnokamyanske. \nOver the last week, attacks intensified. Russian forces assaulted and captured Ukrainian positions on the treeline leading to the southeastern edge of Siversk, which they then used to infiltrate into the city. A number of Russian soldiers scattered in the houses there, leaving the Ukrainian strongpoints to the southeast in an operational encirclement. \nHowever, the main vector of attack on Siversk took place from the south. A number of Russians on motorcycles broke into the southern part of the city, which was already in the grey zone. The surviving infantry then advanced north towards the city centre, scattering in additional residential areas and linking up with the forces from the east. This was achieved with minimal resistance from Ukrainian soldiers on the ground due to Ukrainian manpower shortages inside the city itself, as well as new logistical problems which Ukraine is facing due to recent Russian advances on the flanks. \nDespite this small number of Ukrainian soldiers, a massive number of drones remain in the sky as usual, monitoring every movement and striking anything that moves. Russia deployed only a small number of soldiers in these attacks (likely 30-50, not including already established positions on the southern outskirts), which is not enough to consolidate larger areas and bring in additional supplies and reinforcements. Naturally, due to a lack of Ukrainian manpower, drone operators are now attempting to pick off the Russian soldiers to prevent any consolidation, ahead of small assault groups moving in. Currently, only a portion of the Russian soldiers have been killed/wounded, and work is underway to find the rest of them. Earlier strikes mainly took place in the southern parts of the city but are now moving further north to hit the Russians who penetrated deeper. \nMeanwhile to the south of Siversk, Russian forces have made new advances in Zvanivka. They captured at least 60% of the village, reached its western edge, and are now trying to push further north and consolidate on its northern edge. Advances also took place downhill from the tactical heights next to the railway line, forcing the remaining Ukrainian soldiers still in the salient northeast of Pereizne to withdraw.",
