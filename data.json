Currently, there are 4 bombers stationed at Olenya - it is unclear if the 4th is equipped with missiles or not.\nAdditional flights of Tu-95MS from Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast, to Olenya Airbase will likely take place in the near future, along with redeployments of Tu-160s to Engels-2 Airbase, in preparation for the upcoming attack. Currently, only training of 1 Tu-160 and 1 Tu-95MS has taken place from Ukrainka and is expected to continue tonight on the usual training frequencies. \n2 other Tu-95MS are stationed at Engels-2 Airbase. They are not yet equipped with missiles, as only 1 An-12 cargo plane has arrived at the airbase recently. This was used to equip the 3 bombers from Olenya, along with missiles already stored at Engels-2 from earlier deliveries. \nA number of Iskander-M ballistic missiles have been delivered OTRK installations in Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, as well as northeast of Simferopol, Crimea. Iskander deliveries have likely also taken place to other areas too. \nAccumulation of Geran-2 drones continues, with more than 350 drones stored at launch sites surrounding Ukraine for the upcoming attack.
