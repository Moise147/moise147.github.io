Harassment and threats have been a regular occurrence for me on this cesspool of a platform (Twitter), so it’s nothing new or unexpected.\nFunnily enough, the first and second times I was doxxed actually publicized me a lot, and was one of the main contributing factors to me getting to where I am today. So I guess I can thank Nafo for that lol. \nBut please note, no matter what people do or say to me, I’m not going to stop doing my work. My goal has always been to provide accurate and informative news on wars such as Ukraine, and to expose and publicize the crimes committed by the Russian, Ukrainian, European, and American governments in this horrible conflict which could have ended years ago.\nThat being said, I’m not going to engage in long debates with random users on Twitter about this. I’m never going to change your mind about me or this war, so there’s literally no point. These are worthless arguments that both of us would forget in a few days. I have so many better and more productive things to do both online and in real life. I’ve got a lot on right now, and I’m looking forward to continue what I’m doing while working on my own life. \nAnd to those who support me through liking my posts, commenting, and messaging me, I appreciate you more than you could ever imagine.
