They also captured new treeline positions to the west. Additionally, the Russians resumed their assault operations in the forest west of Novomykhalivka following earlier unsuccesful attacks.\nIn the southwest, at some point recently, Ukrainian forces managed to clear the eastern bank of the Nitrius River southeast of Hlushchenkove and recaptured the lightly-manned positions in the forested areas northwest of Ridkodub. They also managed to consolidate in the remaining treelines southwest of Novyi Myr. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces resumed their attacks in Ridkodub.

      "original": "I feel like I should provide some context regarding my extensive coverage of Russian missile attacks, as it's always been one of the main focal points for my account.\nOver the last 2 years, I've spent over 1,000 hours covering more than 100 Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine live. To my knowledge, I was the first ever OSINTer in the world to provide real-time updates of missile trajectories with maps. But these attacks are only a small part of this war, so why spend so much time and effort covering it?\nFor me, when I first started covering these attacks, I had less than 50 followers on Twitter. Doing something like this brought attention to my account as no one had seen it in public spaces before. As my reporting got significant more accurate, more and more people tuned into my live updates. This provided me with a lot of motivation to continue covering these attacks, allowing for me to get even more precise and reliable. \nThis motivation, combined with me finding a lot of interest in these attacks and learning about so much stuff, meant I just never stopped, despite it being such a small portion of this war's events. \nMore recently, I have frequently been messaged by Ukrainians and people visiting Ukraine thanking me for my coverage as it provided them with knowledge of whether it is safe or not in their respective cities. The Ukrainian Airforce is notoriously slow on updating threats and air raid alerts, which is why far less people use official outlets for this anymore. \nSo, a combination of these factors means that I don't intend on stopping any time soon, even if it restricts my ability to cover other areas of the war such as political developments. Obviously, real-life factors for me can reduce my ability to cover attacks, but I hope to continue as it's good for my account and good for those watching it. \nA big thanks to those behind the scenes who help make this possible.
