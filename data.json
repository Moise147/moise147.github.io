Advances in a war of attrition are not linear, and this is based off the assumption that Putin wants ALL of Ukraine, rather than the 4 Oblasts (which Russia already controls most of). Does anyone remember how slowly Russia was advancing in 2023? Compare that to now where it is several times faster. \nInterestingly, the narrative has shifted from \"1,000 years to take Ukraine at the current rate of advance\", to \"90 years to take Ukraine at the current rate of advance\". I wonder why that is...\nAlso, have you perhaps considered that the reason Putin continues to try to win the war suggests that he knows Russia will win? Or is it too difficult to do critical thinking with actual factual-based analysis these days without automatically being labelled as a Kremlin propagandist, meaning people like you resort to articles backed up by hopium, cherry-picked statistics, and pure assumptions with no logic involved what-so-ever.",
