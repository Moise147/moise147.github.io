Other positions in the surrounding areas were seized, and a general push to the railway line was made, resulting in a ~2.7km long section of it and the trench lines running parallel to it coming under Russian control.\nRussian DRGs then began moving into northern Rodynske, carrying out operations in both the dachas and the northern residential areas. As a result northern Rodynske is currently in the grey zone. Additionally, by exploiting a gap in the trench lines, Russian forces began advancing towards the train station, although it's unclear if they achieved any success. \nTo the north, the Russian were able to complete the capture of Nykanorivka by pushing outwards from their foothold in the southern houses, and from the newly captured positions in the forests to the east. They then went on to establish control over the forests west and north of the village, and began attacking the freight train station at Dorozhnje.
