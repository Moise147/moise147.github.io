The newest attacks have been taking place to the rear of the stronghold village of Shakhove, which Russia is trying to cut off by reaching Toretske. A strong push is also being made from Poltavka.\nAs for the Russian soldiers who were encircled last week, I wanted to wait a little to confirm this, but roughly 20 POWs were taken, around 15 of which surrendered near the small road north of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. The other ~5 were caught in the forests to the southeast. Everyone else was either killed or managed to escape back to the Kucheriv Yar area.\nRussia has now regained the initiative in the Dobropillya direction and is making significant progress. I will post more on that later, though.",

Officers from the Territorial Recruitment Center (TRC), together with police officers, initiated a pursuit of a passenger car whose driver ignored an order to stop near the village of Kasperivka. \nAccording to the driver‚Äôs wife, the reason for the refusal to stop was that they were being signaled to stop by a man in military uniform, not a police officer, who then immediately began hitting their vehicle. She also stated that both the military personnel and the police officers were under the influence of alcohol.\nThe chase continued into the Zhytomyr region, where police finally blocked the car. The situation escalated when a TRC officer smashed the car window. Inside the vehicle were two underage girls, who were in a state of extreme panic, crying and praying. \nRead more \nHERE",
