In Kharkiv, a hit by a long-range air-dropped bomb was recorded, which aligns with reports of Russia ramping up the industrial production of such munitions.\nAgainst this backdrop, according to some experts, the rhetoric of several European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, who formally support the idea of a ceasefire across the entire front line, in practice suggests the opposite.
