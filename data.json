They also improved their positions on the tactical heights to the north, by attacking southwest from the Temyrivka - Zelene Pole road.\nFurther north, after capturing Temryivka, Russian forces advanced uphill and northwest towards Zaporizke, capturing new treeline positions and approaching its outskirts from two directions. They also spearheaded north along the Dnipropetrovsk side of the regional border to Novoheorhiivka, quickly establishing control over the village and forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the adjacent positions. \nAdvances were also made between the Vorona River and a tributary of the Vorona River in Donetsk Oblast, where they were able to push downhill towards Komyshuvakha, while further improving their positions southwest and west of Shevchenko. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to bypass the rest of Maliivka from the north, moving along the heights, and capturing the agricultural buildings as well as the western part of the village, reaching the low-lying ground south of Sichneve. \n+ ~54.9km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
