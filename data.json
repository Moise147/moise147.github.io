Unconfirmed (but plausible) reports state that Doroznje has come back under Russian control, and that Russian forces have re-secured the northern part of Nykanorivka. If true, Ukrainian forces are at great risk of being encircled here. \nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued to attack. They have entered the centre of Boikivka, and carried out unsuccessful attacks on northern Zatyshok after advancing down a treeline in the grey zone.

Ukrainian reinforcements were brought in and kill-zones with FPV drones were formed in the low-rise residential areas. As a result, despite incredibly intense FAB glide-bomb and artillery bombardment of Rodynske and the surrounding areas, Russia failed to breach Ukrainian lines here. \nUkrainian forces in turn began their own series of counterattacks. Utilising their superior forward deployment points in stronger and larger high-rise buildings, the Ukrainians cleared Russian soldiers from the eastern and northern parts of the city, as well as the area of the train station. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued their attacks in the area of the highway, near the pig farms south of Rodynske.\n+ ~1.64 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",
