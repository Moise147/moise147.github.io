After combing operations, the rest of the district was brought under full Russian control.\nAttacks are now being carried out further east through Rivne. Russian forces were able to capture additional positions in the southern houses of the village as they attempt to advance east along the highway towards the northwestern outskirts of Myrnohrad.\nNorthwest of Myrnohrad, Russian forces levelled the frontline east of the northern pincer. After earlier infiltrations they were able to consolidate in the pig farm complex northwest of Svitle, as well as the treelines to the north. Additionally, Russian forces captured the pig farm complex south of Chervonyi Lyman, as well as the rest of the railway windbreaks further south.\nFierce fighting continues in western Rodynske, with no new confirmed changes. \nWith these new changes, for the first time, not a single part of Pokrovsk City is under Ukrainian control. More than 95% is under Russian control, with the rest in a fluid grey zone.",

They established control over the remaining treelines in western Donetsk Oblast, crossing into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where they captured more positions on the tactical heights.\nTo the south, Russian forces widened their spearhead to the rear of Dachne by improving their positions in the treelines further north of the nearby gulley. They were able to capture positions in four separate treelines here.\nTo the southwest, following the Ukrainian withdrawal from the salient north of the Vovcha River, Russian forces levelled the frontline south of the gulley, establishing control over the remaining treeline positions there.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences south of Novopavlivka and advanced up a treeline to the southeastern outskirts of the town. They then entered the town, capturing the southern streets. Once reinforcements were brought in, and positions were captured on the eastern and western flanks of the breach, the Russians advanced further north through the Novopavlivka, capturing additional residential streets. They also improved their positions further in the fortified forest, capturing additional positions north of Filiya.\nTo the west, Russian forces advanced east from Ivanivka to the forests on the northern bank of the Vovcha River. They established control over the positions there, linking up the Ivanivka bridgehead to the rest of the Novopavlivka direction. \n+ ~31.91 km² in favour of Russia.",

DRGs were able to enter the residential part of Orestopil. \nTo the southwest, the Russians continued expanding their zone of control around Zlahoda. They advanced down two perpendicular treelines south and southwest of the village, capturing new positions there. \nTo the south, after securing the central part of Uspenivka, Russian forces managed to capture the rest of the village, along with the agricultural buildings on its southern outskirts. They then crossed the Yanchur River at a new point from Pryvilne, and began advancing down a gulley and adjacent treelines towards Solodke. Russian soldiers quickly captured Solodke due to a lack of Ukrainian manpower in the area and consolidated in the treelines to the east.\nTo the southeast, the Russians advanced south and downhill from Uspenivka towards Nove, capturing positions in several different treelines and entering the village. Other forces advanced towards Novouspenivske from the southeast, crossing a gulley and capturing a forest along with nearby treeline positions to the north, northeast and south. As a result, any remaining Ukrainian soldiers still stationed west of Okhotnyche withdrew further west, allowing for the Russians to establish control over the treelines west of the Yanchur River there.\nFurther south, Russian forces continued to slowly advance west of Malynivka. They captured the rest of the gulley leading west from the village and secured new positions in two separate treelines, therefore reaching the eastern outskirts of Zelenyi Hai.\n+ ~30.98 km² in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "Ukrainian source Deepstate has provided some additional information regarding the deteriorating situation for Ukraine in the Hulyaipole and Pokrovsk'e directions. This, along with some information from other sources allows for us to paint a clearer picture of the events that unfolded here over the past 10 days. \nThey report that 50% of the Ukrainian soldiers defending the area of Uspenivka were withdrawn to improve the deteriorating situation near Vyshneve. At the time, Russia had quickly captured this relatively large village, crossed two rivers, and were advancing well beyond it to the north and west. These reinforcements somewhat stabilised the situation there, but it left a large gap in the defence of the Uspenivka area.\nAs a result, at least 200 Russian soldiers from the 14th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade, 218th Tank Regiment, and the 394th Motorized Rifle Brigade were able to enter Uspenivka, and bring it under their control relatively quickly. The 394th brigade consolidated in the village while the 14th brigade and 218th regiment began pushing to the nearby villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, Solodke, and Rivnopillya. \nIn order to try save the situation, one unspecified battalion of Ukraine's 102nd Territorial Defence Brigade was deployed to Uspenivka, but suffered heavy casualties due to Russia having already brought in significant reinforcements to the village, and just because of the fact that the battalion was low on manpower. \nA severe lack of coordination in cohesion in this sector, along with commanders not accurately reporting the situation to headquarters or neighbouring units, is partially responsible for these rapid losses in ground that should have been able to hold for some time. Critical manpower shortages also play a major role in this. These levels of incompetence, shortages, and inability to coordinate properly are beyond anything I have ever seen for Ukraine so far. \nAs a result of this chain of events over the past 10 days, Russia has been able to fully compromise Ukrainian defences on the western bank of the Yanchur River and is now pushing through the fields further west. Fighting is ongoing for the villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, and Rivnopillya, while Solodke was captured a few days ago. Rybne is also under threat of being encircled due to Russian advances near Zlahoda and Solodke, and all the while, the newly reinforced front further north is still not stabilised.",
