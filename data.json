The Ukrainian 119th Territorial Defense Brigade withdrew to the large forests further west.\nShortly afterwards, Russian forces crossed the border at multiple points further south and entered the village of Hrabovske. Street fighting ensued; however, the Russians were able to bring in considerable amounts of infantry, forcing the Ukrainians to leave. 56 civilians resided there at the time, around 6 of which were evacuated by Ukrainian forces. The rest refused to leave. Russian soldiers evacuated the remaining 50 civilians, all of which are adults who signed waivers of evacuation, to Belgorod Oblast, while assault groups continued their attacks.\nAfter occupying both Hrabovske and Vysoke, Russian forces secured the forests between them, which had a minimal Ukrainian presence due to their proximity to the border. \nHowever, the main push was made further west from Hrabovske to the nearby village of Ryasne. Russian forces managed to penetrate west and capture parts of the forests there. Forward units have already entered the eastern part of Ryasne where fighting is now ongoing. 9 civilians have been evacuated by Ryasne by Ukrainian forces so far.\nThe Ukrainian defence here is held by a unit (119th brigade) which was recently pulled from the Serebryanskyi Forest in Luhansk Oblast to here, as this sector was a much quieter part of the frontline, meaning their combat capabilities are at least somewhat degraded. Currently, most defensive actions are being carried out by FPV drone operators, who are attempting to slow the Russian advance for the time being. \n+ ~13.40 km² in favour of Russia. \nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

      "original": "(Part 1)\nI'd like to make this post to clear some things up about the Ukrainian counterattacks in Kupyansk, my coverage of the events, and what this means for the war.\nFirstly, let's look at the tactical side of things, and how people have reacted to it:\nThese Ukrainian counterattacks did not start when Deepstate posted their famous map update showing most of Kupyansk and the surrounding villages in blue, and multiple pockets of surrounded Russians. The counterattacks started back in early October, and I have been covering their progression since October 15 - nearly two months longer than Deepstate - and longer than almost anyone else on any platform. \nThis was not a surprise operation, but a prolonged, complex, and multi-stage operation that has taken place across multiple months. When I first started posting about Ukrainian gains in very important areas here - namely the advances north of the city towards Russian logistical routes - I was called out by countless Pro-Russian users for spreading \"Ukrainian propaganda\" and \"only mapping off geolocations and Ukrainian sources\". But... when well-known Russian sources and mappers began replicating my map changes in the following weeks, it was *largely* accepted as fact.\nRemember, before Deepstate's announcement of the Ukrainian progress of Kupyansk on December 12, and Zelensky's propaganda video at the Kupyansk steel on the city's outskirts on the same day, there was significant consensus among most of the community who follows this war that there was either no Ukrainian counterattacks, or that they were limited and mostly unsuccessful. \nNow, while I was covering the situation since October 15, I specifically began raising alarm bells for the Russian garrison in the western suburbs of the city on December 2, nearly 3 weeks ago. There, I stated \"The situation could soon reach a critical point for Russian formations in the western part of the city.\" I was specifically referring to the Ukrainian attempts to cut off the Russian logistical routes in the north, and to encircle Russian groupings in the southwest. And, surely enough, other mappers replicated these changes afterwards. \nWhat we've been experiencing recently is an almost identical phenomenon to what is seen constantly in the Pro-Ukrainian community, where Russian advances are denied for weeks, only for them to be accepted with a delay and the usual BS of \"This place served its purpose as Russia suffered tens of thousands of casualties in trying to take it\". We've all seen this narrative on tactically/strategically important places repeat itself over and over again, without fail. \nThe difference with Kupyansk that Russia is almost always on the front-foot and constantly maintains the initiative across nearly the entire frontline. When Pro-Russians are met with a sudden change in the tactical situation in such a critical sector, many end up replicating the age-old tactic employed by Pro-Ukrainians of delaying, delaying, delaying, and then shifting the goalposts once it becomes clear to everyone.\nI expect that Ukraine will indeed secure the entirety of western Kupyansk, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take for many Pro-Russians who have denied this for so long to catch up. \nNow, for the informational side of things:\nThe Kupyansk operation has had massive media and propaganda successes for Ukraine, due to the nature of how this war is covered by mainstream media. Zelensky's video on the outskirts of Kupyansk immediately went viral, with all mainstream media outlets instantly picking it up and spinning their usual narratives about the war and attempting to use it to suggest that it's a turning point for Ukraine or that it reflects a \"dire situation\" for Russia's \"4-year 'special military operation'\". It re-ignited the usual talk that we constantly see of \"Zelensky is brave enough to visit his freedom fighters right on the frontline, while Putin remains in his nuclear bunker, too paranoid and scared to go anywhere, while his commanders send his troops into meat-wave attacks\".",

It had the desired effect - even thought we might know what actually happened - and kept the general public thinking how they want them to.  \nBut, while this has been a big informational success, and a decent tactical success overall for Ukraine, the trajectory of the attrition dealt by Russia continues largely unimpeded. \nRussia is still winning, and other crucial sectors are still falling apart. The so-called \"Pro-Ukrainians\" continue to betray the country and people that they claim to support so strongly by ignoring the critical situations in Myrnohrad, Hulyaipole and Siversk. \nThe war, overall, remains unchanged, and continues to progress towards its obvious conclusion. Only then will the pro-Ukrainian goalposts shift so far away from their original place that the narrative as we know it collapses.",

There will be almost no room left for them in the comfortable rear. The soldiers of fortune are extremely skeptical of the new commander, as evidenced by their unwillingness to serve under him.\nSince the pace of mobilization cannot meet the Ukrainian army’s current needs, command is beginning to take radical steps. Specifically, they are drawing on all available resources from the rear and sending them to the assault troops. Foreign mercenaries who came to earn easy money have now fallen victim to this fate.\nThere are four foreign legions operating within the Ukrainian army. Three are combat units and one is a training unit that replenishes frontline units after a short training period.
