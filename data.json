      "original": "Regarding the situation in the Orikhiv direction, western Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\nBoth Russian and Ukrainian sources are reporting that Russian forces carried out ground attacks on Mala Tokmachka and Novodanylivka..\nRussian sources reported that Russian forces resumed assault operations in Mala Tokmachka, although it's unclear where from. The last known western-most Russian positions in the village were at the local school in the village centre, although it's unclear if those positions were retained. Ukrainian sources report that the Russian attacks were repelled by Ukrainian FPV drone operators but did not provide additional details.\nRussian sources also reported that attacks took place on Novodanylivka. Currently, there is a massive grey zone stretching from the areas north of Robotyne to the southern outskirts of Novodanylivka, however, Russian forces (likely from the 3rd assault company of the 291st regiment) managed to enter the southern houses of the village. It is currently unclear if they were able to establish any positions there, however. \nThese reports are corroborated by Sentinel imagery, which shows a massive increase in fires burning both on the frontline, and in Ukrainian controlled territory north of Mala Tokmachka on August 29. Almost all of these fires burnt out by August 30. Some small damage to buildings in Mala Tokmachka, likely from FPV drones, was recorded in the central part of the village, but nothing to suggest increased usage in that area.\nAdditionally, according to my information, large artillery duels and FAB bombardment has occurred south of Zaporizhzhia City since August 28. Heavy artillery shelling targeted Ukrainian positions in the area for around an hour straight in the early hours of the morning on August 31. At least 16 glide-bombs were dropped on Ukrainian positions at around 11:30pm for a period of roughly 20 minutes on August 30. Significant FAB bombardment also targeted the town of Malokaterynivka, around 14km south of Zaporizhzhia City on the night of August 28-29, resulting in large fires burning uncontrolled in the dachas and residential areas for over 24 hours. Russian artillery shelling did continue through to August 31, albeit at a decreased rate, and some of it was concentrated on areas west of Orikhiv.",

      "original": "Recent Russian strategic bomber movements suggests that another large-scale combined missile attack on Ukraine is imminent. \nFollowing the strikes on August 31, most of the bombers returned to airbases close to Ukraine and remained there, rather than flying to the far east for equipment with Kh-101 cruise missiles as usual. 2 Tu-95s landed at Olenya Airbase, Murmansk Oblast, 1 Tu-95 landed at Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast, and 1 Tu-95 landed at Diaghilev Airbase, Ryazan Oblast. \nCurrently, the following aircraft are located near Ukraine:\nOlenya Airbase: 2 Tu-95MS\nEngels-2 Airbase: 3 Tu-95MS, 1 Tu-160\nDiaghilev Airbase: 3 Tu-95MS.\n2 of the Tu-95s at Engels-2 have been equipped with missiles. The status of the third is unknown. Notably, the number of flights to Diaghilev has increased, with one of the aircraft which took part in the most recent combat flight landing there afterwards. \nAs for the Tu-160 that launched missiles during the most recent attack, it flew to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast, in the far east where it is probably also being equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles. \nIt is also important to remember that for around 2 weeks, Russian decreased their usage of Iskander-M ballistic missiles, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and significantly decreased their usage of Geran-2 drones. This indicates that stockpiles were built up of these weapons, and while they will have burnt through a decent amount of them since then, there will still be a lot left over.",
