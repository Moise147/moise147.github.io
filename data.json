They were able to quickly capture the remaining positions north of the Siversk - Lyman highway and began advancing south down the treelines to the rear of the chalk quarry. \nOther forces advanced directly west from Siversk, capturing the trenches just outside the city and quickly entering the chalk quarry from the east.

Since then, the Russians have continued to push west along the tactical heights and occupied new positions in the forest plantations and treelines further west, almost levelling the frontline between Platonivka and Sviato-Pokrovske. Additionally, they were able to complete the capture of Sviato-Pokrovske - establishing control over its western outskirts - and are now engaged in battles for the eastern outskirts of Riznykivka.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces advanced from the strongpoints along the highway and entered the first houses of Ozerne, capturing its northern street. Further west, other forces broke through to the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and entrenched in the northwestern-most houses of Ozerne. \nIn the northwest, Russian forces continued to expand their zone of control in Dibrova and managed to fully capture the eastern half of the village.
