Russian FPV drone operators are attempting to cover the infiltration routes in order to limit the number of soldiers reaching the western approaches to the town. \nIn the east, Ukrainian forces counterattacked in the direction of the railway line between Kotlyne and Udachne, recapturing positions along three parallel treelines. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued their attacks both east and west of the Pokrovsk Coal Mine's waste dumps, while DRGs began infiltrating further northwest through the forest plantations in the direction of Serhiivka. \n+ ~1.44 km² in favour of Ukraine.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

Renewed fighting is also ongoing for Ivanivka, and Russian soldiers are continuing their attacks in western Nove Shakhove.\nTo the northeast, Russian forces continued advancing north from Shakhove and captured new positions southwest of Toretske.

However, more recently, they have begun struggling with supplies due to increased Ukrainian FPV drone strikes on the area between the city and Oleksandro-Shultyne. \nMeanwhile, at some point recently, Ukrainian forces managed to clear the Hora District of northeastern Kostyantynivka from Russian DRGs, as well as the adjacent forests, where they are now trying to accumulate.
