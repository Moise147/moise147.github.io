They are now trying to infiltrate even further south, entrenching south of Novopavlivka and reaching the gulley east of Filiya where they are attempting to clear the strongpoints there. \nAs a result of these attacks, and attempts to cross the Solena River from the west, the remaining Russian formations in Novopavlivka are operationally encircled and have no ground supply lines leading to their positions. \nMeanwhile, to the southwest, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Filiya and established control over the rest of the fortified forest there, pushing the Ukrainians back to the treelines further north.\n+ ~23.60 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.83 km² in favour of Russia.",

This document significantly impacted the country's foreign policy. It outlines the primary issues in the realm of US national security and the planned solutions.\nThe strategy indicates the direction in which Americans will focus their political, economic, and military efforts in the coming years. The first edition of the strategy was released in 1987 during the Reagan administration. Since then, each administration has published at least one version of the strategy.
