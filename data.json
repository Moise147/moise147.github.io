They re-entered the northwestern streets, and in coordination with attacks from the northeast and southwest, pushed the Russians back beyond the Solena River. From there, the Ukrainians consolidated in the northern streets and began a general push back to the town centre, reaching and establishing control over it. \nAdditionally, despite earlier withdrawals, the Ukrainians were able to dig in east of Novopavlivka and begin pushing back towards its rear, advancing along several treelines and recapturing positions along the western face of the tactical heights. They are now trying to infiltrate even further south, entrenching south of Novopavlivka and reaching the gulley east of Filiya where they are attempting to clear the strongpoints there. \nAs a result of these attacks, and attempts to cross the Solena River from the west, the remaining Russian formations in Novopavlivka are operationally encircled and have no ground supply lines leading to their positions. \nMeanwhile, to the southwest, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Filiya and established control over the rest of the fortified forest there, pushing the Ukrainians back to the treelines further north.\n+ ~23.60 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.83 km² in favour of Russia.",

It presents a new vision of the current situation in Europe. The previously monolithic unity of the West is beginning to crack.\nIn November 2025, the U.S. government published a new National Security Strategy. This document significantly impacted the country's foreign policy. It outlines the primary issues in the realm of US national security and the planned solutions.\nThe strategy indicates the direction in which Americans will focus their political, economic, and military efforts in the coming years. The first edition of the strategy was released in 1987 during the Reagan administration. Since then, each administration has published at least one version of the strategy.
