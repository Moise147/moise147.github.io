FABs also targeted almost every part of the village held by the AFU, causing significant casualties among their forces and slowing their advance. \nRussian FAB glide-bombs then struck the bridge between the two reservoirs, connecting the centre to the eastern part of the village, to complicate further Ukrainian movement west. The remaining Russian soldiers were then withdrawn from the village centre. \nDespite this extensive bombardment, Ukrainian soldiers managed to cross the tributary and establish positions in a few houses in the northwest of the village. The Russians tried to cut off the Ukrainians in the northwest by attacking to the northern street from the area of the reservoirs but were forced to retreat back after encountering heavy resistance, indicating further Ukrainian reinforcements have been getting brought in. \nAt the same time, Ukrainian forces had to withdraw from the gulley west of Kindrativka back to the treeline to the south, after being hit by over a dozen FABs and failing to consolidate. It's likely that this was a diversionary attack for the main operation on Kindrativka from the west, tying up Russian forces and complicating their movement in and out of the village.\n+ ~4.95km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

Other forces then crossed the fields to Varachyne, where fierce battles ensued for the eastern houses. Russian forces exploited Ukraine's weakened forward position northwest of Varachyne and was able to push from Novomykolaivka to the intersection of three treelines, applying additional pressure on the Ukrainian soldiers in Varachyne. \nEventually Russian soldiers captured the village, and established full control over the treelines to the north.

They advanced east along the railway line, utilising the cover from the windbreaks on either side of the tracks to infiltrate Russian trench positions and dugouts, recapturing them and reaching the main trench strongpoints at the bridge. \nOnce this strongpoint was under Ukrainian control, and positions had been recaptured in the adjacent forest, small groups of Ukrainian soldiers moved east across the open fields and infiltrated the southeastern part of Stepova Novosilka at two points. \nMeanwhile, Russian soldiers slightly improved their positions to the north, crossing a gulley and establishing control over a small treeline to the west. \n+ ~2.28km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.33km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

I agree with a lot of this, although I believe the actual speed is a little more than Mach 5, not due to delays in explosions but rather delays in detection due to them usually flying over border and lightly populated areas of Chernihiv Oblast. \nUsually, we don't know about it until it is either approaching Kyiv Oblast or already over the region - sometimes even only when the explosion is heard in Kyiv from the Mach Cone phenomenon. I think it's probably closer to Mach 6, but that's just speculation. \n@cym27s\n is a good person to follow. He's one of the two other main English-speaking missile trackers and does very similar work to me - but also at hours when I'm not online or asleep. Go get him to 9k followers, and also try to convince him to make a telegram channel lol.\nThread link: \nhttps://x.com/cym27s/status/1947592482172375112",

      "original": "I'd like to point something out regarding the recent DRG operations, and specifically the attached video showing a Russian sabotage operation deep inside Pokrovsk City.\nThis is nothing new - at least in the sense that these deep infiltrations behind the frontlines have been occurring for several months now. As I and many others have been pointing out for a long time, Ukrainian manpower problems will eventually reach a point where they are unable to contain Russian infantry. Right now, we are at the point where they cannot contain all DRGs and are failing to kill them within the required period of 12-24 hours. \nDRGs have been constantly slipping behind Ukrainian lines simply because there are no soldiers to stop them in some areas. They utilise cover from treelines, windbreaks and the more lightly damaged settlements to evade being spotted by drones, and then carry out sabotage operations on Ukrainian positions multiple kilometres behind the frontline on unaware soldiers and commanders in temporary deployment points. This is what I mean when I point out how relying on one thing to hold parts of the frontline (drones) is not a good tactic nor a good sign as it significantly simplifies Russian assault operation - they don't have to account for as many factors. \nYes, the number of DRG operations in the Pokrovsk direction has significantly increased, but the main reason we are seeing this is because of how much attention Pokrovsk is getting right now. This is a common occurrence in weak sections of the frontline, and even sometimes much more stable sectors such as the frontline northwest of Bakhmut.",

Supporting attacks were made from the area of Mayak to secure the forested areas next to the reservoirs. \nRussian forces were also able to consolidate their positions in southern Mayak, using them to expand further north and seize the rest of the village. Assault operations are now ongoing on the neighbouring village of Pankivka, which is currently in the grey zone. Outflanking attacks have already taken place west of Pankivka, with Russian forces achieveing a localised breakthrough towards the village of Nove Shakhove, where they captured numerous positions in the treelines and forest plantation on the tactical heights, while forward units cut the Nove Shakhove - Shakhove  road and are now operating northeast of Nove Shakhove. Due to the fog of war, it is unclear if any positions were captured along the road itself, however. \nMeanwhile, east of the Kazenyi Torets River, Russian forces completed the capture of the village of Novotoretske by advancing northwest from their positions behind the tributary of the Kazenyi Torets River. Then, taking advantage of Ukraine's critical manpower situation, the Russians broke through Ukrainian positions northwards, advancing along the road to Volodymyrivka, before reaching and capturing the main part of the village just south of Shakhove. Other forces made further progress to the southeast in the treelines on the tactical heights, and the adjacent forest plantations in the low-lying ground. \nTo the east of these breakthroughs, Russian forces improved their positions west of the village of Popiv Yar, and captured parts of the treelines outside the chalk quarry. \nTo the southwest of these breakthroughs - in the direction of Rodynske - Russian forces completed the capture of the village of Fedorivka, reaching the eastern outskirts of Zatyshok and seized additional positions in the nearby forest and treelines. Soldiers which had already consolidated in the treelines east of the Krasnolymanskaya Mine, advanced north to one of the ventilation shafts for the mine, capturing it and therefore linking up with the forces from Fedorivka. \n+ ~31.54km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
