      "original": "Reflections:\nA year ago, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (along with several civilians), dealing a brutal blow to the organisation after several setbacks in military and intelligence operations.\nThe Syrian resistance commemorated the anniversary of his martyrdom, emphasising Hezbollah's work in its fight against the Zionist entity over the years, highlighting Israel's defeat in southern Lebanon at the beginning of the 20th century.\nNasrallah's death marked a turning point in the power of Hezbollah and Iran in Lebanon. A few months later, the fall of the previous Syrian political regime made this setback even more visible. Hezbollah is currently undergoing a process of reconstruction, facing external and internal pressures to the point of displaying a passive attitude towards the Syrian terrorist authorities, something that would have been unthinkable ten years ago.\nThe Syrian resistance is now seeking to take over from Hezbollah as the main opposition to the state of Israel in the Levant, emphasising solidarity with the Palestinian cause and normalisation with Jolani, who has been Syria's main enemy in recent decades.\nHowever, I believe that this position is neither correct nor favourable for a successful movement in Syria. The regional situation has changed completely. December 2024 marked the end of any Arab nationalist project and the Arab League's complete passivity towards Israel prevailed, leaving Iran as the as the only state opposing Tel Aviv. The tragic events we have witnessed in Syria in recent months have completely fractured Syrian society along identity lines, leading to the proliferation of self-determination movements on the coast & Suwayda (concretely here when under the previous political regime the Druze sought only more autonomy) with the aim of freeing themselves from the yoke of those who seek to eradicate them on sectarian grounds.\nThe only solution that could solve the problem (if there is a solution) is the creation of a Syrian (not Arab) civic nationalist movement capable of uniting the different confessions under a single identity. The priority of the Syrian resistance should be to continue liberating the country from terrorist groups and not to embark on external ventures such as Palestine, whose future unfortunately seems doomed.\nIn other words, the Syrian resistance should take as its model the liberation of southern Lebanon in 2000 & the liberation of Mount Hermon in 1973 & not the liberation of al-Quds nor the creation of a new Sunni of Shia axis. Nothing beyond Lake Tiberias should be a priority.",
