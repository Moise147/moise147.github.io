Casualties on both sides were roughly ten to ten, but the occupiers, as usual, fired at everything in sight and killed civilians.\nNow, a bit of schizophrenia from the Zionist media. First, “Israeli” media(“channel 13”) claim that \"the operation was carried out in coordination with Syrian security services,\" which again puts the al-Qaeda regime in an awkward position. In effect, the al-Julani regime has begun to implement Thomas Barrack's orders, when he previously stated that \"the new Syria will now cooperate with the United States in the fight against Hezbollah and Hamas.\" Then other channels began to claim that at least one of the Syrian martyrs was allegedly connected to the Tahrir al-Sham regime's intelligence...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
