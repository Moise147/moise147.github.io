Gen. Shlomi Binder shared this information with visiting United States Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz earlier this week, in a sign that Israel is again urging Washington to act against Iran.\n“This is a threat that Israel will not be able to accept for long, and we must coordinate with the Americans the red lines and actions we will take in the future, perhaps even in the near future,” a source familiar with the matter told Al-Monitor.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
