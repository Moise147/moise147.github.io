Russian forces maintain control of the residential areas immediately north of the E-50 Highway. \nAdditionally, Ukrainian forces advanced in the Pervomaika District of Pokrovsk, pushing southwest from the city centre and the northeastern part of the district, clearing the local school and several surrounding residential blocks which the Russians previously infiltrated.\nOn the otherhand, Russian forces continued their operations in the eastern part of Durniak District. They captured most of the industrial zone west of the E-50 highway, as well as some positions in the adjacent residential streets which they are now using to infiltrate the western part of Pervomaika District. \nFurther east, Russian forces recaptured some positions in the Market District.

They then crossed the Sinna River, entering and securing the first houses of Myrnohrad on Stritenska and Syedova Streets. Ukrainian forces responded by withdrawing for a few hundred metres, and striking each individual house not under their control with multiple FPV drones, attempting to kill all the Russian soldiers who entered the village. \nAdditionally, Russian forces were able to capture new positions in the treelines and forest plantations west and northwest of Hrodivka after Ukrainian forces withdrew to the village of Promin. \n+ ~9.24 km² in favour of Russia.",

They were also able to make further progress to the north, capturing two treelines, and gaining a foothold in the forest plantations on the southeastern approaches to Shakhove.\nMeanwhile, despite widespread reports, Volodymyrivka is not under Russian control. The Russians control the southern part of the village, and have not properly consolidated in the centre due to constant Ukrainian drone strikes. After the Russians broke into Volodymyrivka, Ukraine resorted to covering almost the entire village with FPV drones and artillery, striking anything that moves, which resulted in much of the initial Russian assault groups being killed or wounded. Additional reinforcements have managed to enter the village, and new attacks are now underway towards the northern streets. Ukrainian forces currently control a single street in the north of the village, which is constantly being hit by Russian FPV drones. Ukrainian movement to and from these positions is incredibly difficult. \nAdditionally, Russian forces are continuing their assault operations towards the Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley east of Sofiivka, but are still having no success due to constant Ukrainian drone and artillery strikes. \n+ ~3.16 km² in favour of Russia.",

All of these positions are on the tactical heights, allowing for the Russians to increase their presence above Ivanopillya from the east. \nAdditionally, due to repeated Ukrainian FPV drone and mortar strikes, and a lack of stable supply, Russian forces withdrew from most of the dachas southeast of Kostyantynivka. They do, however, maintain control over a small section of them in the east.

They made further progress in the forest northwest of the town, before Russian soldiers on motorbikes advanced down the road from Shandryholove, and entered the town. Positions were captured in the outermost buildings, and fighting is ongoing in the grey-zone further south. Additionally, Russian forces continued attacking from the Derylove area, where they were able to capture positions in three separate treelines on the tactical heights overlooking Drobysheve. Fighting is now underway for the agricultural buildings on the outskirts of the town. \nFurther west, Russian forces were able to cross the Nitrius River from the Drobysheve Fish Farm into Novoselivka. They established a foothold in the houses on Tsentralna Street and Ukrayinska Street, before pushing northwest towards the western part of the village. Other forces advanced north towards the centre of the village where they are attempting to squeeze the Ukrainians out from multiple directions. Heavy fighting continues here.\nTo the north, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions in the forests northwest of Novoselivka under heavy FAB, artillery, and drone cover, establishing control over additional positions there. They then went on to advance south, cutting the  Novoselivka - Oleksandrivka road at the graveyard, while capturing further forested positions down the road to the northwest. Additionally, Russian FPV drone strikes on Ukrainian logistics and bridges has increased in intensity in this sector, complicating supply to critical parts of the frontline like Novoselivka.\nIn the north, Russian forces advance from their positions west of Shandryholove, into the forested gulley to the west, establishing full control over it.
