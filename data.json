Ukrainian forces resumed their assault operations towards the treelines south of Nykanorivka, attacking from their positions east of the railway line.\nIn the eastern part of the Kucheriv Yar salient, fierce fighting is ongoing for the Volodymyrivka - Shakhove area. After repelling Russian assaults on northern Volodymyrivka, and inflicting heavy casualties on the initial force dropped off by the earlier mechanised assault, Ukrainian forces began attacking south from the northern street with their newly accumulated infantry, and captured new residential areas in the northern part of the village.

This, plus renewed Russian attacks towards the centre of the village from the north forced the remaining Ukrainian formations to withdraw west. \nOther forces to the northwest were able to consolidate in the large forests after previous attacks and began expanding further west. They were also able to enter these same forests from southwestern Novoselivka and capture positions there, forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw further back from areas directly west of Novoselivka to the eastern approaches to Yarova. \nAdditionally, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions south of Novoselivka, where they advanced southwest through the forests and infiltrated the southeastern houses of Yarova. Fighting is now ongoing here, but it means that one of two remaining roads to Drobysheve (which was also previously used to supply Lyman) has been cut.\nMeanwhile in the east, Russian forces continued to slowly advance in Drobysheve. After capturing the agricultural buildings on the northeastern outskirts of the town, they entered the residential areas to the south. The main assault groups continued to push towards the town centre and have established control over positions on Pushkina Street.\n+ ~8.44 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They advanced along the railway line for more than 2.9 km, seizing numerous trenches and dugouts along the way. Once they reached the eastern outskirts of Pishchane, the Russian began entering the village, capturing trenches and houses there. \nSo far, they are only confirmed to be in control of the easternmost edge of the village, while the rest is in the grey zone, but they have attempted to consolidate in the northeastern streets. Meanwhile, additional attacks were carried out to the north, where Russian forces captured new treeline positions in the low-lying ground. \n+ ~3.57 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
