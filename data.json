They claimed that 805 Geran-2/Gerbera drones were launched. This is corroborated by the massive number of targets that were hit in several different regions. \nInterestingly, this attack was not accompanied by Kh-101 cruise missiles. This reflects the continued trend of Kh-101s being used less and less, as they likely get phased out of this war in favour of Iskander-K, Kh-69, and Kalibr cruise missiles.",
