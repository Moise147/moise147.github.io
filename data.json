They broke through further Ukrainian positions, clearing them and establishing control over a section of the river's northern bank, encircling Ukrainian formations against the river to the east. \nFrom there, Russian forces began clearing the salient west of Dibrova, where they captured numerous positions and trench complexes, meeting up with assault groups advancing south of Torske. Ukrainian forces were withdrawn over the Siverskyi Donets River to the Dronivka area, with the Russians establishing a solid line of contact in the direction of the Zherebets - Siverskyi-Donets River intersection.\n+ ~30.20km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

The Ukrainians maintained control over the northeastern houses of Katerynivka to allow for a full withdrawal to neighbouring Kleban-Byk to take place. \nOnce this withdrawal was completed and the Russians were in full control of Katerynivka, they were able to quickly enter Kleban-Byk. They reached Zelena Street in the village centre, and occupied seven 3-story buildings, the local school, and numerous other positions in the southern residential area. \nMeanwhile, east of Kryvyi Torets River, the Russians completed the capture of the town of Shcherbynivka and captured further positions along the windbreaks next to the railway line. \n+ ~4.84 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
