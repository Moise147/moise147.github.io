Otherwise, diplomacy could devolve into a continuation of the war by more sophisticated means. \nIn this scenario, Ukraine risks becoming a pawn in the great powers’ geopolitical game, and the principles of international law and state sovereignty could be sacrificed for short-term political interests and pragmatic calculations.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
