About four days after we were brought here, we realized we were surrounded by the Russians. Resupply was gone – no ammunition, our water ran out, very little food was left. We ate one can of stew among three men per day. The route across the Oskol River was already cut off – it's all your FPV drones there. Because of that, there was no logistics left.
