One of those such posts got over 1.6 million views.\nI even had the \"Pentagon Pizza Watch\" account reach out to me asking if my map could be embedded in his external betting service. He proceeded to get angry at me when I pointed out how immoral and scummy it was, and how when he used Deepstate's API, it ultimately got their service temporarily taken down, leaving many people - including humanitarian aid workers - in the dark. \nBetting on a war where hundreds of thousands of people are dying and millions are suffering is immoral and disgusting, and I will never support it or take part in any of it.
