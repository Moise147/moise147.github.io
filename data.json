Other forces consolidated in the northeastern streets, and began attacks on the rest of the northern part of the village, capturing additional residential areas and the industrial buildings. \nUkrainian forces then attempted to cross the Kryvyi Torets River to seize northwestern Ivanopillya, but suffered heavy casualties in the process. Nevertheless, the Russian consolidation process was disrupted, and work is underway to strike the surviving Ukrainian soldiers with FPV drones. Additionally, Ukrainian forces managed to re-enter the northern part of Pleshchiivka, however there is no evidence of consolidation here yet. \nTo the north, Russian forces consolidated in additional positions in the Santurinivka and Stare Selyshche Districts of Kostyantynivka and continued pushing towards the railway station and the two high-rise buildings south of the T-0504 Highway. Additionally, the Russians captured five more blocks of houses in the eastern part of the Santurinivka District, entering the Tram Depot and the forests to the north. Ukrainian forces attempted a flanking counterattack southward from the forests to the trenches in the fields west of Predtechyne.
