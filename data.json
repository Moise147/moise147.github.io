Additionally, construction work can be seen at the destroyed hypermarket next to the airport, although it's unclear if this is military related or just for restoration purposes. \nSome are saying that these new actions are to transform the destroyed airport into a Geran-2 drone launch point, although it is known that launches of Gerans have been taking place from a training ground near Donetsk City for the past two weeks already, although this will be further east than the airport. \nDonetsk International Airport was the epicentre of battles in 2014-2015 (where is sustained almost all of its damage) and remained on the frontline until the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024. At the closest point, it is roughly 35km away from the frontline. \nImage credit: \nt.me/MiliTJournal/28924",

They completed the capture of the southeastern streets, establishing control over the adjacent trench strongpoint, while improving their positions in the south of the village. \nA mechanised attack was then carried out with the goal of securing the road from Serebryanka, but this was repelled with significant losses. \nSouth of the Plotka River, Russian forces were able to recapture positions in and around the orchards between the reservoirs and began a general push westward along the treelines. Once a solidified presence was established north of the large reservoir, Russian soldiers stormed the trench networks at the terykon overlooking Siversk. They crossed the ponds and cleared the trenches, establishing a presence on the eastern slope of the terykon.\nTo the south, Russian forces moved back into western Verkhnokamyanske - which was in the grey zone - and cleared the largely empty positions in the basements of the ruins. \n+ ~18.84km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
