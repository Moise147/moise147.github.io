The numbers of missiles launched are higher than what I've listed, as the number of missiles detected was lower than actual launches.  \nThe main targets for this strike was Ukrainian energy infrastructure. The following was hit:\nKryvyi Rih Thermal Power Plant (47.53961, 33.66377).\nKremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant (49.07513, 33.25208).\nKaniv Hydroelectric Power Plant in Cherkasy Oblast (49.76286, 31.46968).\nPrydniprovsk Thermal Power Plant in Dnipro (48.40742, 35.11378).\nKyiv CHP-5 Power Station (50.39317, 30.56947).\nDnipro Hydroelectric Powerplant in Zaporizhzhia City (47.87109, 35.07956). \nUnknown target in Kamianske, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.\nUnknown target in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.\nUnknown target in Kremenchuk, Poltava Oblast. \nWidespread power outages are reported across Ukraine, with approximately 50% of Kyiv now without electricity.
