The fall of Pokrovsk will be just one thing in a chain of events that trend towards collapse for Ukraine, and there is still much more to come. Attritional warfare prioritises degrading your enemy's ability to fight, and the territory you gain in the meantime is - for the most part - a biproduct of successful attrition. \nThere wasn't really a turning point for this war, as Russia is the larger country, with superior capabilities, and the ability to keep up the fight far longer than Ukraine, meaning they are destined to win unless something drastic and revolutionary happens. There are many reasons for this, of which I have outlined in the past. \nPokrovsk is just the \"new Bakhmut\" - the city that the media focuses on. You could even consider it Zelensky's PR city. I don't think Pokrovsk will be forgotten like the 2023 Zaporizhzhia counteroffensive, or the 2024-2025 Kursk offensive, however, as it will probably be labelled as the turning point further down the line.",

      "original": "Update from the Pokrovsk direction:\nThe battle for Pokrovsk is approaching its end as the parts of the city begin to come under Russian control.\nIn the northern part of the city, Russian forces established control over new positions in the northernmost residential neighbourhoods, fully establishing themselves along the southern bank of the Hrishynka River. Additionally, they advanced from the area of School no. 14 and the northwestern industrial zone, to the remaining residential streets not yet under Russian control, capturing new positions towards the northern outskirts.\nIn the northeastern part of Pokrovsk, Russian forces consolidated in the southern part of the high-rise district and operationally encircled the remaining Ukrainian formations in the district. To the southeast, they made additional progress in the low-rise residential areas towards the eastern outskirts of the city, establishing control over most of the rest of the buildings there.\nThe most important news comes from the bottleneck of the Myrnohrad pocket. After entering the high-rise district and compromising it as a blocking position against attempts to physically cut off Myrnohrad, Russian forces advanced beyond northeastern Pokrovsk, past the cemetery, and to the highway, where they entrenched in the windbreaks. From there, they entered and captured the soft drinks factory and infiltrated into the northwestern part of Rivne.\nOn the northern end of the bottleneck, the Russians advanced from their positions near the pig farm and reached the high-rise intersection, establishing full control over it and the surrounding positions. They then went on to advance west down the road, where they have reached the next pig farm complex.\nCurrently, there is a ~1.3 km corridor of open fields and a small, disconnected residential area consisting of two short streets connecting the Myrnohrad pocket with the rest of the front. This area is entirely in the grey zone, and movement in and out of the pocket is now practically impossible. The vast majority of formations still in the pocket will either be killed or captured. \nMeanwhile, north of Pokrovsk, Russian forces began counterattacking against the Ukrainian infiltrations in northern Rodynske. They were able to quickly retake the northern low-rise residential area, and begin assaults on the Ukrainian soldiers entrenched in the three-story buildings. Extremely fierce fighting is ongoing here, with both sides making use of extensive fire power. Some Ukrainian soldiers have been encircled, while others still reside in the grey zone. \n+ ~4.57 in favour of Russia.",
