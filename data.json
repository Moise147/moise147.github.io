Once this was complete, they attacked down the gulley from Vesele to Kucheriv Yar, entering the village, establishing control over it, and taking POWs. They also secured the positions surrounding the village, including the gulley leading south from Hruzke.\nTo the southwest, Ukrainian forces were able to consolidate in the village of Vilne after repelling earlier Russian attacks, and recaptured positions in the forests to the northeast which the Russians were using as staging grounds and infantry accumulation points to attack Vilne. \nIn the east, Russian forces managed to enter Shakhove from the west, moving along the gulleys and forests.
