At the closest point, it is roughly 35km away from the frontline. \nImage credit: \nt.me/MiliTJournal/28924",

They were able to break out of the village, and captured the treeline to the north. Once reinforcements were brought in, a four-vector attack was carried out on the positions on the western approaches to Oleksiivka. Russian forces were pushed back into the village, and back to the forest plantations lining the reservoir to the north. \nAn attack was carried out on the agricultural buildings on the western outskirts of Oleksiivka, which are now in the grey zone. Ukrainian forces also have fire control over the last road out of the village, significantly complicating Russian movement in and out of it. \n+ ~4.48km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",
