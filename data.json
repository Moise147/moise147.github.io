Over the last few months, Ukrainian forces have been conducting localised counterattacks in various places across the front when they hold a slight numerical advantage. However, this has significantly depleted the overall situation for the AFU, as the strategic whack-a-mole game grows in intensity. Gaps are opening up more frequently, and in greater magnitude. The biggest example was the Zolotyy Kolodyaz breakthrough, which forced Ukraine to pull elite Azov units from the Serebryanske forestry and Kupyansk, as well as regular units from Pokrovske direction. What we saw was the clearest evidence of the whackamole theory yet, as villages toward Pokrovske tumbled, the Serebraynske forest, which had held out for over 2 YEARS collapsed immediately, and Russian forces now controlling over half of Kupyansk. The whack a mole game continues, and will continue, with larger and larger gaps opening up, until the eventual end of organised resistance by the AFU. To be vulnerable and honest, i've made so many mistakes predicting a timeline of collapse, so im not gonna try to predict a timeline again lol. But collapse is happening, in stages, gradually.",

They were able to capture positions along Lermontova Street, which leads to Sobolivka, while assault groups penetrated further south to the high-rise buildings of the Yuvileynyi Neighbourhood in the southwest of the city. \nEast of the Kupyanka River, Russian forces improved their positions in the residential areas and reached the industrial zone in the centre of Kupyansk. They are now bypassing the Ukrainian \"Comb\" stronghold in the high-rise micro-district in the northern suburbs which the Russians previously failed to enter. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to carry out assault operations in the area of the Central City Hospital, while Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian attacks in the city centre. \n+ ~0.96 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "In the Pokrovske and Hulyaipole directions, Russian forces continue to rapidly advance west towards the Yanchur River, making new progress in three areas.\nIn the south, Russian forces continue approach the chain of settlements along the Yanchur River, advancing further along the treelines on the tactical heights north of Olhivske, and improving their positions along the heights southwest of Novoivanivka. \nFurther north, the Russians advanced north from Novoivanivka capturing additional treelines and supporting the assault operations to Novohryhorivka. Deep advances were made along the gulley on the Dnipropetrovsk - Zaporizhzhia Regional Border, with Russian forces approaching the rear of Novohryhorivka. \nIn Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, after taking Novomykolaivka, Russian forces stormed the eastern outskirts of Kalynivske, while aviation and artillery worked on the main Ukrainian defensive nodes in the area. This collapsed the Ukrainian defense of the flanks and allowed for the Russians to quickly take the lightly defended village of Kalynivske, as well as the adjacent fortifications. The fall of Kalynivske allowed for Russian forces to push along the treelines on the tactical heights to the south, and level the front south of Kalynivske. They were also able to capture positions northwest and north of Kalynivka in the forests and treelines in the low-lying ground, approaching Stepove from the south. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to develop their offensive in the area of Sosnivka. They were able to capture another treeline north of Berestove, and secured a series of treeline intersections northwest of Ternove, forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the salient south of Sosnivka. \n+ ~39.80 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
