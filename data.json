Its contracts focus on several hot spots, where traders place bets on the timing of the capture of specific cities. Trading is most active for key locations such as Kostyantynivka, where there is ongoing heavy urban fighting, and Orikhiv, to whose distant approaches Russian troops have successfully advanced.\nHowever, the market clearly shows operational difficulties. A notable example is the situation near Kupyansk, where the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a large-scale counteroffensive in late December, pushing Russian forces back from part of the right bank of the city. This event undoubtedly adjusted forecasts and timelines, making the capture of the entire city unlikely in the next month. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
