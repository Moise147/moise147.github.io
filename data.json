      "original": "Уже не перша доповідь за цю добу від командувача наших Повітряних сил. Уточнюємо всі наявні дані, аналізуємо деталі цього російського удару.\nЩе вночі українські військові повідомляли польській стороні відповідними каналами інформацію щодо руху російських дронів. \nБлизько 00:50 за київським часом був зафіксований перший перетин російським дроном державного кордону між Україною та Польщею. Щонайменше два російські дрони, які залетіли на територію Польщі протягом ночі, використали повітряний простір Білорусі. Загалом щонайменше кілька десятків російських дронів рухалися вздовж кордону України і Білорусі та в західних областях України, наближаючись до цілей на території України й, очевидно, Польщі. \nКількість російських дронів, які перетнули кордон Польщі та значно заглибились на її територію, може бути більшою від попередньо озвученого числа. За оновленими даними, цієї ночі загалом близько двох десятків російських дронів могли здійснити рух у повітряний простір Польщі. Перевіряємо.\nНаші сили захисту неба знищили більш ніж 380 російських дронів різних типів. Щонайменше 250 із них – «шахеди». Точна інформація щодо типів дронів буде встановлена після аналізу уламків.\nУкраїна готова до розширення нашої з партнерами співпраці для надійного захисту неба. Щоб не тільки інформування чи обмін розвідданими, але й реальні спільні дії в небі гарантували безпеку сусідів. Росія повинна відчути, що європейці вміють захищатися.",
