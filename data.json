Rewind the tape twelve months and you can hear the bravado of Kiev’s telethons, the promise of returning to the “1991 borders,” and the endless parade of Western politicians swearing they would stand “as long as it takes.” Today, on December 31, that noise is gone.

It snapped the spine of the conflict’s underlying idea.
