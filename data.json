They crossed the Vorona River from Sosnivka and advanced northwest up the treelines towards the Vovcha River. Other assault groups continued advancing west along the southern bank of the Vovcha, and began attempts at entering the forest east of Velykomykhailivka. \nRussian forces also crossed the Vorona River at a point further west, advancing down a treeline east of Orestopil and reaching the southern bank of the Vovcha directly south of Velykomykhailivka, therefore levelling the frontline between Orestopil and the positions west of Novoselivka.\n+ ~5.34 km² in favour of Russia.",

Additionally, some soldiers are trying to infiltrate the small forest west of Hryshyne, however it's unlikely that they were able to consolidate there. The Ukrainian command has brought in new reinforcements to Hryshyne, where they are now probing Russian positions in the dachas on the southeastern outskirts of the village. This is significantly complicating further Russian progress in the area.\nIn northern Pokrovsk, Russian assault groups managed to consolidate in the agricultural complex north of the Hrishynka River, and in the first houses of the city's northernmost street and adjacent dachas. Small assault groups continue to operate in this area but are unable to bring it under full control due to the constant presence of Ukrainian soldiers, who have brought in significant reinforcements. \nNorth of Pokrovsk, due to a lack of Ukrainian manpower here, Russian forces managed to consolidate in the first pig farm complex along the road towards Hryshyne as well as along the treeline running parallel with the road. They continue to operate in the area of the second pig farm, without consolidation yet. \nIn the southern part of the Myrnohrad pocket, Russian forces began advancing east from Novopavlivka to the nearby trench fortifications. Other forces broke through Ukrainian positions in southern Myrnohrad and advanced through the low-rise residential streets, reaching the southwestern outskirts of the city. This forced a Ukrainian withdrawal from the southern part of the pocket, allowing for the Russians to establish control over numerous trench fortifications and treelines, as well as two sets of railway windbreaks. \nIn the rest of Myrnohrad, Russian forces continue attempts at expanding their zone of control south of the high-rise buildings of the Zapadny District, pushing through the grey-zone in the low-rise residential areas. They are also trying to further expand their foothold in the southeastern part of the Zapadny District and are carrying out assault operations in the northeastern high-rise blocks of the city, in the direction of the local school and kindergarten.\nIn Rodynske, Russian forces regained the initiative in the city, re-establishing control over the eastern part of the city centre. Violent battles are now ongoing for the central-most block of Rodynske, where Ukrainian forces are attempting to counterattack from the area of the administrative building to the northwest. Additionally, other Russian assault groups managed to push the Ukrainians back from some of the three-story buildings on Chervonolymanska Street, and are attempting to push north to Myru Street, where Ukrainian soldiers are heavily entrenched. \n+ ~16.99 km² in favour of Russia.",
