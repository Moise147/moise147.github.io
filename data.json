In the southeast, they continued to push southwest down the forest plantations in the low-lying ground, seizing new positions there and in the forested areas. Using the cover provided, they were able to enter the outskirts of Shandryholove and captured some of the agricultural buildings there. Battles are ongoing for the other buildings, with Ukrainian forces holding their main presence in the residential part of the village.\nRussian forces also advanced to the east, capturing the rest of the gulley from Zelena Dolnya, before advancing to and clearing positions on the adjacent tactical heights.\nIn the northwest, Russian forces made additional progress down the eastern bank of the Nitrius River, advancing south to the next two forests, capturing them and two nearby treelines. \n+ ~9.13km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They captured the agricultural buildings on the outskirts, and positions in the houses on and around Tsentralna and Radhospna Streets. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to advance through the northern residential area, capturing additional positions on and around Pivnichna Street. \nThe main Ukrainian presences in Torske are in the central section and the fish-farm in the far north.

In the southwest, they continued their operations to clear the village of Shcherbynivka. After they captured the southern and main part of the village, they entered the northern part and began clearing the area of the railway line. Russian forces captured most of the rest of the village, including the local school. They were also able to clear the rest of the positions in the pocket west of Shcherbynivka due to the progress inside the settlement. \nFurther east, Russian forces cleared the remaining positions in western Toretsk after the last Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from the city and captured the rest of the adjacent Toretsk Forest. \nIn the northeast, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Dyliivka, and established control over positions on four different treelines on the tactical heights.\nAdditionally, in the west, Russian soldiers managed to enter the western part of Katerynivka, although it is unclear if any positions were established. \n+ ~8.27km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
