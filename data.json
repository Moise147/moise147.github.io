They state that crew survived and was evacuated by an Mi-8 helicopter.\nThis suggests that the distant explosion heard from Zaporizhzhia city at around 4:05 am was unrelated to this aircraft. While there was an air raid alert in place for all of Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Oblast at the time, no tactical aircraft activity or launch maneuvers were reported.\nKeep in mind, launch maneuvers can be missed, and a declared target can be misidentified if the glide-bombs are targeting something \"in front\" of it (e.g. hitting Lyman instead of Slovyansk). If the Su-34 was shot down, the Ukrainian Airforce could be stating that it was targeting Zaporizhzhia City for informational effect due to the intensity of attacks on the city over the past 5 days.",
