Despite this, the large guitar-shaped trench fortification to the south is yet to be seized.\nTo the northwest, following high activity of Russian DRGs in and around Pokrovsk, Russian forces were able to establish full control over the rest of Zvirove and the adjacent terykon, before establishing a foothold in the Kalynivka district of Pokrovsk in the area of Kyyivska Street. Positions in the treeline and fortifications to the south were also captured.
