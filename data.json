      "original": "It seems that Russia’s next large-scale, combined missile attack on Ukraine has been delayed, as no significant strategic bomber movement has been recorded for the last two days.\nIn my opinion, this is due to the prioritisation of smaller, more targeted attacks on Odesa Oblast with Geran-2 drones, Grom-E1 rocket glide-bombs, and Iskander-M ballistic missiles. \nAdditionally, the preparation of a number of Tu-22m3 strategic bombers is underway. Two of them, each equipped with 2 Kh-32 cruise missiles, redeployed from Belaya Airbase, Irkutsk Oblast, to Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast. 2 other Tu-22m3 bombers stationed at Engels-2 Airbase are also equipped with 1 Kh-32 missile each. \nIt’s also likely that two Buyan-M corvettes were equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles at Kaspiysk Naval Base, Republic of Dagestan, in the Caspian Sea. They can launch a maximum of 16 Kalibrs. \nHowever, 2 days ago, 1 Tu-160 and 1 Tu-95MS strategic bomber redeployed from Engels-2 Airbase to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast. There, they will likely be equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles.\nRemember, another 4 Tu-95MS are already equipped with missiles at Olenya Airbase, Murmansk Oblast, ready for use. \nAs for Iskanders, deliveries of Iskander-M ballistic missiles and possibly Iskander-K cruise missiles were carried out to OTRK installations in Voronezh and Rostov Oblast.\nMass accumulation of Geran-2 and Gerbera drones continues at all major launch sites surrounding Ukraine.",

Attacks are now underway, with the Russians attempting to penetrate deeper into the region.\nAs usual with these sorts of incursions, the goal is not to take large swaths of territory. The goal is to stretch Ukrainian forces even thinner, worsening the issues coming from their manpower shortages.\nIf Ukraine decides to redeploy units away from one direction to this new area in order to reinforce the lines, halt, and possibly even push back Russian forces, the area which they are redeployed from will be significantly weakened, making it easier for the Russians to make progress in.\nThis is all part of what I like to call Russia's \"Whack-a-mole\" tactic, which softens up the lines, and exploits the successful attrition being dealt to Ukraine right now. It puts Ukraine in a difficult spot, as if they choose not to redeploy here, the incursion zone could continue to expand and become even more difficult and costly to deal with later on. \nEssentially, they are trying to put out more fires than they can possibly deal with - and Russia keeps setting new ones. The main reason why they can't deal with all of the fires at once is because of manpower shortages, which are only continuing to get worse.\nExpect more maneuvers like this in different places from Russian forces in the future.",

The Ukrainian 119th Territorial Defense Brigade withdrew to the large forests further west.\nShortly afterwards, Russian forces crossed the border at multiple points further south and entered the village of Hrabovske.

The rest refused to leave. Russian soldiers evacuated the remaining 50 civilians, all of which are adults who signed waivers of evacuation, to Belgorod Oblast, while assault groups continued their attacks.\nAfter occupying both Hrabovske and Vysoke, Russian forces secured the forests between them, which had a minimal Ukrainian presence due to their proximity to the border. \nHowever, the main push was made further west from Hrabovske to the nearby village of Ryasne. Russian forces managed to penetrate west and capture parts of the forests there. Forward units have already entered the eastern part of Ryasne where fighting is now ongoing. 9 civilians have been evacuated by Ryasne by Ukrainian forces so far.\nThe Ukrainian defence here is held by a unit (119th brigade) which was recently pulled from the Serebryanskyi Forest in Luhansk Oblast to here, as this sector was a much quieter part of the frontline, meaning their combat capabilities are at least somewhat degraded. Currently, most defensive actions are being carried out by FPV drone operators, who are attempting to slow the Russian advance for the time being. \n+ ~13.40 km² in favour of Russia. \nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",
