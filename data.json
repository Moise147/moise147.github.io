      "original": "The video posted by Creamy Caprice is of a DRG. Even if it was a normal soldier, it wouldn't necessarily mean control over the area. Russian forces do not control Sobolivka or Moskovka, fighting is ongoing for the latter. \nThis soldier got this far because Ukraine doesn't have enough manpower here (and in many other sectors) to hold a cohesive defence, so they rely on drones - and drones miss things... constantly. \nEven if an assault detachment slipped through Ukrainian lines and gained a foothold, Russia would really struggle in bringing in supplies and reinforcements to exploit it. It's why we (mostly) don't see deep penetrations with only a few soldiers, but rather prolonged, incremental and shallow attritional movements with overall larger groups of soldiers.\nBut hey, remember, according to those \"super reliable\" Russian channels who are now proudly displaying the \"liberation\" of new areas and the beginning of the encirclement of Kupyansk, Sobolivka should have been under Russian control on July 6! \nIt's almost as if many Russian channels, including the Russian Ministry of defence (which also reported this) are propaganda outlets not trying to show the true situation on the frontline! A lot of these channels are either catering to an audience, or on a payroll. The same goes for Ukrainian propaganda outlets, except they mostly use different tactics.",

      "original": "Here's approximately what the situation looks like:\nAround 60% of Moskovka is under Russian control. Daily incremental progress is being made. \nSobolivka is behind Moskovka, and the highway to Kupyansk and Ukraine's Oskil bridgehead is further south. I think the location of the highway is one of the reasons why Russian channels are talking about Sobolivka so much.\nAs you know, DRGs are operating in Sobolivka. This is nothing new and has been ongoing for over a month. Ukraine doesn't hold much of a presence in the village and is likely mainly in the surrounding forests or in Kupyansk. \nAs for Kupyansk itself, don't be surprised if the Russians fail to consolidate on the edge of the city centre, and the Ukrainians take back certain areas. Ukraine still controls almost all of the high-rise buildings, making Russian movement difficult. The low-rise residential areas are the easiest to clear in a city like this - you will know why if you see what the interior of these soviet-era apartment blocks look like. \nIt will be interesting to see if Russia focuses more on cutting the highway south of Sobolivka, or in the city centre of Kupyansk.",
