This culinary experiment was timed to celebrate the birthday of American astronaut Zina Cardman. Cosmonauts Alexey Zubritsky and Oleg Platonov prepared an adapted version of the Olivier salad, which is known outside Russia as the \"Russian salad\".\nThe dish was prepared using ingredients available on the station. Most components of the traditional recipe were on hand, with the exception of canned green peas. An interesting substitute was found in the form of smoked quail eggs, which were located in the station's Japanese food supplies. The process of chopping and mixing required particular precision, and the cosmonauts successfully prevented any food particles from floating away in the weightless environment.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
