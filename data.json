Chapayeva Street was considered one of the last areas of Tetkino not yet under Russian control and still had a small Ukrainian presence. The Russians were able to establish control over the majority of this street and pushed to the west, capturing a cluster of houses on the outskirts of the town, further increasing their presence on the eastern bank of the Seym River on the Kursk side of the border.\nMeanwhile, artillery bombardment of Ukrainian positions in the village of Ryzhivka has intensified. Ukrainian forces have in turn increased their FPV drone strikes on Tetkino and Russian supply routes further into the rear. Russian Geran-2 drones have been striking Ukrainian drone operator positions in the rear as well. Despite the increased intensity of fighting, there has been no noticeable increase in Ukrainian airstrikes on Kursk.\nIn the east, Russian forces resumed attacks in the village of Bezsalivka, which is largely held by Ukrainian drones. Russian soldiers managed to marginally advance in the northern houses and forests on both sides of the Volfa River. Russian artillery shelling of Iskryskivshchyna has intensified, and strikes are being carried out on Ukrainian drone operator positions in order to support assault operations in Bezsalivka and nearby areas.\n+ ~0.64 km² in favour of Russia.",

They have since renewed their attempts at storming the eastern part of Kindrativka, but have so far achieved no confirmed successes. \nTo the southeast, Russian forces were able to full capture the treeline stretching between Andriivka and the southern part of Oleksiivka, allowing for the remaining positions on the western approaches of Oleksiivka to be occupied. \nFrom there, the Russians launched an attack on the southeastern part of Andriivka, and managed to consolidate in a few houses there. Ukrainian forces carried out counterattacks against these positions but were unsuccessful due to increased numbers of Russian FPV drones being used. The Ukrainians also carried out an attack towards the northern outskirts of Andriivka, but this was repelled too. Russian artillery shelling has intensified on Andriivka and the surrounding areas, supporting their assault operations. \nIn the east, Russian forces continued to advance near Varachyne. They managed to recapture the treeline leading to its northeastern outskirts and entered the first houses of the village. Assault operations are now underway on Ukrainian positions in the southern houses. \n+ ~5.26 km² in favour of Russia",

They then advanced beyond Hurkanivska Street and are engaged in fierce fighting for the residential blocks there.\nTo the southwest, Russian forces intensified their storming of Vilcha, despite the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements. They captured the rest of the windbreaks on either side of the railway line and pushed east down the treeline north of the town. Then, in coordination with attacks from the east, Russian soldiers advanced south down a perpendicular treeline, entering the northern streets of Vilcha. Advances were also made in the western streets towards the town centre. \nIn the west, Russian forces resumed their assault operations in the forests west of Synelnykove.
