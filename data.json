This was reported by Oksana Hryhorieva, gender advisor to the General Staff of the AFU. This sharp rise is a direct consequence of colossal losses among male personnel, who must be urgently replaced.\nAs Hryhorieva notes, female graduates of military universities from 2019 have already attained the ranks of captain and major. Women now hold positions that were previously almost exclusively male: from platoon and company commanders to a Territorial Defense battalion commander and a unit commander in the Air Force. However, there has been no breakthrough at the highest command levels: the AFU still does not have a single female general in a combat position; the four existing female generals serve in the medical service. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
