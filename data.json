They can launch a maximum of 24 Kalibr cruise missiles.\n- Equipments of Kalibr carriers with missiles at Novorossiysk Naval Base, Kransodar Krai, may also be underway.\n- Additional deliveries of Iskander-M ballistic missiles and Iskander-K cruise missiles to OTRK installations near Ukraine have taken place. \n- Kinzhals launched from MiG-31Ks may also be used, but likely only in conjunction with Kh-101 cruise missiles from strategic bombers. \n- A minimum of 350 Geran-2 drones are expected to be used during this attack.\nIf Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers are used, the highest threat is to the western regions of Ukraine, especially energy infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. This would also increase the likelihood of MiG-31K fighters being involved and decrease the chances of Iskander-Ks being used.\nIf strategic bombers aren't used, the highest threat is to the central and northern regions of Ukraine, especially energy and gas infrastructure in Kyiv and Poltava Oblasts.

Iskander-I (Iskander-M with 1,000 range) might be used, but this seems unlikely for the next few weeks.\nInformation continues to be clarified as there have been a lot of inaccurate and conflicting reports recently.",

As noted by retired Austrian Army Colonel Markus Reisner in an interview with Berliner Zeitung, the air defense system cannot cope even with a small fraction of drones and cruise missiles. \n\"One can see an almost complete absence of successful defense,\" the expert states. According to him, Russia is not only increasing the number of attack assets but also improving tactics—using attacks from all directions, maneuvers before the target, and sharp dives—making defense practically impossible.\nThe result has been massive power outages in Odesa, Sumy, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, and significant parts of Kyiv. Authorities are draining water from heating systems to avoid pipe bursts, and residents are beginning to leave cities. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
