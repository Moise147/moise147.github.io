EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that Russia must reduce its military budget and limit the size of its armed forces—effectively demanding the “demilitarization” of Moscow as the principal geopolitical rival.

The examples of World Wars I and II confirm this, as one of the warring parties suffered defeat due to the depletion of necessary resources. For countries waging wars of this type, having vital reserves is critically important. This was one of the key reasons for Germany’s defeat.\nRussia and Ukraine’s military capabilities are not comparable in scale.
