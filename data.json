Due to recent emergency Ukrainian redeployments to the Hulyaipole direction, the Ukrainians were unable to carry out their usual clearing operations on Ahrarna Street, allowing for Russian soldiers to accumulate and cross the river at multiple points.\nFrom there, the Russians secured Tavriivska Street and outflanked the block of high-rise buildings in central Stepnohirsk from the east and west, capturing additional positions in the residential areas. Infiltrations are now taking place towards the rear of the high-rises, as well as into its southern buildings, where grey-zones have formed.\nMeanwhile, in the southeast, Russian forces resumed their assault operations, recapturing previously lost positions in eight different treelines northeast of Kamyanske.\nIn the northwest, the Russians consolidated additional positions in the southern part of Prymorske, while DRGs continue infiltrating to the second gulley.\n+ ~6.37 km² in favour of Russia.",
