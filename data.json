They then entered Sichneve from the north, and established control over the northern part of the village, as well as the nearby treelines on the tactical heights. Since then, a series of Russian counterattacks forced the Ukrainians to withdraw from both Sichneve and Novoselivka, with both villages now being situated in the grey zone. \nIn the west, Ukrainian forces began attacking towards Sosnivka, and established control over the northwestern-most street of the village. They entered the main part of the village shortly afterwards, although there is no evidence of consolidation at this moment. Positions were also recaptured in the adjacent treelines. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces infiltrated through the grey zone of mixed positions for around 4.5 km to the eastern edge of Oleksiivka, which they were able to infiltrate. It doesn't appear that they were able to consolidate, however, and were probably picked off by Ukrainian FPV drones. \n+ ~10.82 km² in favour of Ukraine.",

Fighting is ongoing for additional parts of the mine. \nTo southwest, Ukrainian forces were able to expand their bridgehead on the southern bank of the Solona River, and recaptured the rest of Novomykolaivka, advancing to the agricultural buildings on its outskirts.

They were able to capture most of the high-rise buildings here, and infiltrated further into the Pivdennyi, Shakhtarskyi, and Soniachnyi Districts, where a large grey-zone has formed. Most of the fighting is centred on the Shakhtarskyi District, where the Russians are attempting to advance beyond the E-50 Highway. \nTo the west, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian positions west of Pokrovsk, and captured three parallel treelines leading up the railway line. Meanwhile, in the western suburbs of Pokrovsk, their zone of control shrunk after they failed to consolidate in the Durniak District, however, infiltration attempts continue in the Durniak and Pervomaika Districts, where Ukrainian forces are increasingly using FPV drones to contain their advance. \nOn the other hand, Russian forces withdrew from the Market District of Pokrovsk, allowing for the Ukrainians to regain control over the eastern market and surrounding residential areas. \n+ ~3.89 km² in favour of Russia.\n+ ~0.39 km² in favour of Ukraine.",
