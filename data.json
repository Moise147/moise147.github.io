In turn, Ukraine once again targeted a dam in the Belgorod region and carried out a drone raid on Moscow.\nThe use of new types of glide bombs with record-breaking range for this class of munition by Russian aviation has sharply increased the destructive force of massive air raids on rear-area targets and placed an additional burden on Ukraine's already depleted forces. \nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
