By the evening, several districts of Kyiv, including the city center, were left without electricity. According to reports, these disruptions were caused by accidents on high-voltage power lines. Repair work is underway, but the timeline for full restoration remains unknown.\nMost likely, the \"accident on the high-voltage lines\" reported by DTEK is not a local incident, but a systemic consequence of recent strikes by Russian forces on CHP-5, the loss of reserves at CHP-6, and the degradation of the 330 kV backbone following attacks...\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
