      "original": "In the Kostyantynivka direction, Russian forces continued to advance and completed the capture of Toretsk City. \nRussian forces advanced in two areas. In the southwest, they continued their operations to clear the village of Shcherbynivka. After they captured the southern and main part of the village, they entered the northern part and began clearing the area of the railway line. Russian forces captured most of the rest of the village, including the local school. They were also able to clear the rest of the positions in the pocket west of Shcherbynivka due to the progress inside the settlement. \nFurther east, Russian forces cleared the remaining positions in western Toretsk after the last Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from the city and captured the rest of the adjacent Toretsk Forest. \nIn the northeast, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Dyliivka, and established control over positions on four different treelines on the tactical heights.\nAdditionally, in the west, Russian soldiers managed to enter the western part of Katerynivka, although it is unclear if any positions were established. \n+ ~8.27km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
