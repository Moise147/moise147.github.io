No consolidation has occurred here yet. \nTo the north, Russian forces continued pushing west through the Pynkiv Yar Gulley, slowing advancing through the forests towards its end. They were able to take additional positions here despite fierce Ukrainian resistance. \nFurther north, Russian forces began a new series of attacks west of Zarichne aimed at fully pushing the Ukrainians away from the village. After repelling Ukrainian counterattacks, they were able to break out of northwestern Zarichne into the Shablyn Yar Gulley, which was quickly brought under Russian control. This forced the Ukrainians to begin withdrawing from their strongpoints in the forests and agricultural buildings to the south to prevent being encircled. A large grey-zone has since formed at the abandoned positions, but the Russians have managed to take some positions in the eastern treelines and buildings. \nTo the northwest, over the past week, Russian forces have been carrying out assault operations on Stavky. After breaking into the village from the trenches to the north, Russia was able to consolidate in the northernmost houses and begin pushing south, fighting for each building towards the centre. A grey zone has now formed, encompassing the local school and surrounding areas, with the Ukrainians putting up fierce resistance despite Russian advances in the surrounding areas.\nTo the west, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences along the Drobysheve - Stavky Road and captured treeline positions there. They then advanced further, cutting the dirt road leading to Stavky and entering the nearby treelines, further pressuring the remaining Ukrainian formations in the village.\nMeanwhile, Russian forces continue to carry out assault operations in northern Drobysheve, and are trying to advance from the agricultural buildings and northern streets towards the town centre.

The Russians were able to capture the Svyatohirsk Water Treatment Facility and gained a foothold in the forests of the national park. Due to a critical lack of manpower in this direction, Ukrainian forces put up limited resistance as the Russians advanced through the forests on multiple axes. \nRussian forces advanced west through the forests towards the Sosnove - Oleksandrivka Railway Line and Road and are rapidly approaching it. They are also advancing down the road to western Yarova, and captured new positions in the forests there. Additionally, the Russian soldiers who infiltrated southeastern Yarova were forced to withdraw after meeting fierce resistance from the Ukrainian garrison there and instead began attacks towards the village from forested areas further west. \nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their counterattacks in the village of Ridkodub. As a result of intensified attacks, they were able to recapture the agricultural buildings on the northern outskirts of the settlement, while the Russians largely pulled back to its easternmost street.\n+ ~7.09 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.\n+ ~0.50 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

They were able to take the poorly consolidated Russian positions there and used them to push further into the treelines southeast and east of Kindrashivka. \nUkrainian armoured vehicles were able to advance further, and approached the western bank of the Oskil River, but were subsequently destroyed by FPV drones. Most of the infantry in the vehicles were killed shortly afterwards, and the chances of consolidation in these areas is next to zero. Nevertheless, Russian logistics into Kupyansk have been complicated. While all supply was already being carried out on foot through fields and forests, this shortening of the gap that can be used will make things more difficult and could delay the eventual fall of the city. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued to advance in Kupyansk itself.

This allowed for the Russians to break out of the village and take up new positions in the forest and treelines to the south. \nFrom there, a new incursion was made across the border in the direction of Bolohivka.

They then began attacking Bolohivka from the northeast, while other forces advanced downhill and southeast along the treelines from their earlier incursion zone. This allowed for them to enter the village from two directions and quickly seize control over it.\nSince then, Russian forces began a new series of attacks in the area between Bolohivka and Odradne.
