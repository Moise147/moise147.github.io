      "original": "US, UK, France All Fail In Hypersonics, As Macron Urges NATO To Catch Up To Russia\nHypersonic technologies are the last frontier in kinetic warfare. It's now a given that the ability to develop and build such weapons defines a country's status as a global military power. The Soviet Union had an unprecedented half-century-long lead over the rest of the world in the development and deployment of these weapons systems. Although this slowed dramatically during the troubled 1990s, Russia still retained a comfortable 30-year lead even then.\nIn the meantime, China experienced economic and technological growth that has rarely (if ever) been seen in human history. Namely, the country was still recovering from the turbulent period that started with the British aggression during the Opium Wars. Beijing's \"time of troubles\" was largely over by the early 1990s, with its resurgence to a global power status.\nAt present, China is the only country that comes close to Russia's hypersonic dominance. There are also smaller regional powers, specifically North Korea and Iran, which have made tremendous strides in hypersonic technologies.
