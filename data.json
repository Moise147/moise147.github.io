This leads to only a temporary loss. \nMeanwhile, the figures on Russian refining capabilities always get skewed to show total amount per refinery (per year), and not what is actually lost... which is only part of the refining capabilities for part of a year.\nAt the same time, everyone seems to be ignoring the hundreds of Russian Geran-2 drone STRIKES (not launches, strikes) per week that are hitting targets of military significance and contributing massively to the overall war of attrition.\nBut don't worry... just 50 more days and Russia will collapse.",
