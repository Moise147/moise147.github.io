      "original": "In the Pokrovsk'e and Hulyaipole directions, over the past five days Russian forces have continued their offensive operations, capturing new positions in several different areas. \nIn the north, Russian forces advanced from positions east of Oleksivika towards Orestopil, establishing control over two separate treelines and some nearby forest plantations. DRGs were able to enter the residential part of Orestopil. \nTo the southwest, the Russians continued expanding their zone of control around Zlahoda. They advanced down two perpendicular treelines south and southwest of the village, capturing new positions there. \nTo the south, after securing the central part of Uspenivka, Russian forces managed to capture the rest of the village, along with the agricultural buildings on its southern outskirts. They then crossed the Yanchur River at a new point from Pryvilne, and began advancing down a gulley and adjacent treelines towards Solodke. Russian soldiers quickly captured Solodke due to a lack of Ukrainian manpower in the area and consolidated in the treelines to the east.\nTo the southeast, the Russians advanced south and downhill from Uspenivka towards Nove, capturing positions in several different treelines and entering the village. Other forces advanced towards Novouspenivske from the southeast, crossing a gulley and capturing a forest along with nearby treeline positions to the north, northeast and south. As a result, any remaining Ukrainian soldiers still stationed west of Okhotnyche withdrew further west, allowing for the Russians to establish control over the treelines west of the Yanchur River there.\nFurther south, Russian forces continued to slowly advance west of Malynivka. They captured the rest of the gulley leading west from the village and secured new positions in two separate treelines, therefore reaching the eastern outskirts of Zelenyi Hai.\n+ ~30.98 km² in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "Ukrainian source Deepstate has provided some additional information regarding the deteriorating situation for Ukraine in the Hulyaipole and Pokrovsk'e directions. This, along with some information from other sources allows for us to paint a clearer picture of the events that unfolded here over the past 10 days. \nThey report that 50% of the Ukrainian soldiers defending the area of Uspenivka were withdrawn to improve the deteriorating situation near Vyshneve. At the time, Russia had quickly captured this relatively large village, crossed two rivers, and were advancing well beyond it to the north and west. These reinforcements somewhat stabilised the situation there, but it left a large gap in the defence of the Uspenivka area.\nAs a result, at least 200 Russian soldiers from the 14th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade, 218th Tank Regiment, and the 394th Motorized Rifle Brigade were able to enter Uspenivka, and bring it under their control relatively quickly. The 394th brigade consolidated in the village while the 14th brigade and 218th regiment began pushing to the nearby villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, Solodke, and Rivnopillya. \nIn order to try save the situation, one unspecified battalion of Ukraine's 102nd Territorial Defence Brigade was deployed to Uspenivka, but suffered heavy casualties due to Russia having already brought in significant reinforcements to the village, and just because of the fact that the battalion was low on manpower. \nA severe lack of coordination in cohesion in this sector, along with commanders not accurately reporting the situation to headquarters or neighbouring units, is partially responsible for these rapid losses in ground that should have been able to hold for some time. Critical manpower shortages also play a major role in this. These levels of incompetence, shortages, and inability to coordinate properly are beyond anything I have ever seen for Ukraine so far. \nAs a result of this chain of events over the past 10 days, Russia has been able to fully compromise Ukrainian defences on the western bank of the Yanchur River and is now pushing through the fields further west. Fighting is ongoing for the villages of Nove, Novouspenivske, and Rivnopillya, while Solodke was captured a few days ago. Rybne is also under threat of being encircled due to Russian advances near Zlahoda and Solodke, and all the while, the newly reinforced front further north is still not stabilised.",

But Ukraine has become increasingly reliant on drones, often spreading infantry very thin across lines, creating a disorganised and often incoherent ground defence. Myrnohrad is an example of this, and there are a lot of nearby settlements that are good for concentrations of drone operators. \nAdditionally, many Ukrainian soldiers actually escaped this pocket back when it was still a salient. This is what allowed for Russia to penetrate deeper into the northern and southern parts of the city. \nFor an area of its size, with a significantly reduced garrison, I estimate that there are anywhere between 300 and 700 Ukrainian soldiers currently trapped there. It's impossible to know how many right now, but with the state the war is in today and other patterns observed from this front, it will be less than many people expect.",
