After the last section of the Siversky Donets line fell, Russian forces began focusing on capturing positions outside the large, fortified forest southeast of Stupochky, and then storming it. Neither of these goals were achieved. \nAfter their successful defence in the forest, Ukrainian forces then attempted a series of counterattacks towards the highway northwest of Predtechyne, but were unsuccessful. However, this did tie up Russian forces in the area and eventually led to the Russians attempting to advance towards the eastern dachas of Kostyantynivka. Nevertheless, Ukrainian forces were able to consolidate in the forest north of the highway and began advancing towards Predtechyne.
