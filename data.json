This, combined with poor Ukrainian coordination, incompetent commanders, disorganisation, and catastrophic levels of manpower shortages, resulted in the Ukrainians being completely unable to carry out any form of containment operations, despite more than two new brigades being redeployed here.\nThere were two main assault vectors that Russian soldiers took. The first, and most significant, was west of the Velyka Balka Gulley, where they penetrated to Zolotyi Kolodyaz and entrenched in the southern street of the village. Other forces turned west, crossing the Hruzka River and bypassed the village. They moved northwest and uphill along two separate gulleys and managed to physically cut the Dobropillya - Kramatorsk Highway at two points\nThe second attack vector was east of the Velyka Balka Gulley, where Russian forces captured three quarries, and bypassed the village of Kucheriv Yar from the east, moving north along the treelines on the tactical heights towards the villages of Vesele and Hruzke, which both lie on the banks of the Hruzka River. Once they reached the southern bank of the river, the Russians crossed it and establishd control over around half of Vesele, where they are accumulating reinforcements for further attacks. Other forces moved down from the heights and into Kucheriv Yar (which was largely empty), occupying it with little resistance. \nAs for DRGs, they have begun to turn west, infiltrating through the fields around Rubizhne, Stepy, Novyi Donbas, Vilne, Novovodyane, Vesele Pole, and Nove Shakhove, where they entered the cities of Dobropillya, and Bilozerske. Dobropillya is seeing more DRG activity than Bilozerske as Russian forces don't have to go as far through the wedge to reach the city. \nMeanwhile, further south, Russian forces continued to clear positions northeast of Bilytske. They re-established control over the forest west of Nykanorivka, and advanced along the treeline to northern Dorozhnje. They also made further progress in the treelines south of Nove Shakhove. \n+ ~48.31km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "The disaster for Ukraine in Pokrovsk-Bilozerske continues to unfold. \nHere's what we know has happened:\nA new breakthrough was achieved towards Hryshyne from the east following weeks of DRG activities. The full extent of this breakthrough remains unknown, but DRGs are operating on the outskirts of both Hryshyne and Novooleksandrivka. This makes the second to last road out of Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad unusable.\nDorozhnje and the freight train station of the same name have been occupied after over a week of battles, along with Ivanivka and Nove Shakhove to the north. \nDRGs continue to operate in and around Novyi Donbas  and on the approaches to Dobropillya. No new DRG activity within Dobropillya's city limits has been recorded over the past 12 hours. \nThe 12th \"Azov\" Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine was deployed to Rubizhne (circled in green), which has prevented it's capture. Nevertheless, Zolotyi  Kolodyaz - the focus of the initial media frenzy - has come under Russian control. DRGs continue to operate on the approaches to Hruzke. \nRussian forces captured the Krasnolymanskaya Mine and the adjacent terykon. They also secured part of eastern Rodynske and made additional progress in Chervonyi Lyman. \nNovoekonomichne has come under Russian control, and progress was made northwest of Hrodivka and west of Myrolyubivka. \nThe rest of Lysivka has moved into the grey zone, with unconfirmed reports of its capture. Suhkyi Yar and the guitar-shaped fortification continue to hold.\nRussian forces continue to push north through western Pokrovsk and completed the capture of Leontovychi.\nPositions were improved in northern Kotlyne and east of the village.\nSouthern Udachne and the town's train station was captured by Russian forces. Most of the rest of the town is a kill-zone or in the grey zone. \nThe remaining Ukrainian soldiers in Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, and the surrounding villages are about to be encircled if nothing is done very soon. Only one road remains even slightly safe for a withdrawal to take place. \nI will make a full and more accurate map update tomorrow, but I thought I should share these developments sooner rather than later.",
