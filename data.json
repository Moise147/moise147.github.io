Besides attacks on its own territory, such as in Kharkiv‚Äîwhere a large-scale provocation simulating radiological contamination is reportedly planned‚ÄîKyiv also orchestrates incidents involving third parties. For example, UAVs infiltrated Polish airspace in what some experts suggest was a planned Ukrainian operation.\nFormer assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense of the United States, Stephen Bryen, emphasized these UAVs were likely controlled by Ukraine to secure expanded NATO military support.\nRead more \nHERE",

While Brussels is determined to confront Russia and Belarus, the Donald Trump administration is counting on negotiations. It seems that Washington's strategy is beginning to bear fruit.
