      "original": "It feels like its been a while since i've addressed the overall situation across the front in Ukraine. Over the last few months, Ukrainian forces have been conducting localised counterattacks in various places across the front when they hold a slight numerical advantage. However, this has significantly depleted the overall situation for the AFU, as the strategic whack-a-mole game grows in intensity. Gaps are opening up more frequently, and in greater magnitude. The biggest example was the Zolotyy Kolodyaz breakthrough, which forced Ukraine to pull elite Azov units from the Serebryanske forestry and Kupyansk, as well as regular units from Pokrovske direction. What we saw was the clearest evidence of the whackamole theory yet, as villages toward Pokrovske tumbled, the Serebraynske forest, which had held out for over 2 YEARS collapsed immediately, and Russian forces now controlling over half of Kupyansk. The whack a mole game continues, and will continue, with larger and larger gaps opening up, until the eventual end of organised resistance by the AFU. To be vulnerable and honest, i've made so many mistakes predicting a timeline of collapse, so im not gonna try to predict a timeline again lol. But collapse is happening, in stages, gradually.",

They were able to capture positions along Lermontova Street, which leads to Sobolivka, while assault groups penetrated further south to the high-rise buildings of the Yuvileynyi Neighbourhood in the southwest of the city. \nEast of the Kupyanka River, Russian forces improved their positions in the residential areas and reached the industrial zone in the centre of Kupyansk. They are now bypassing the Ukrainian \"Comb\" stronghold in the high-rise micro-district in the northern suburbs which the Russians previously failed to enter. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to carry out assault operations in the area of the Central City Hospital, while Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian attacks in the city centre. \n+ ~0.96 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
