Швидко опанувавши нову техніку, українські льотчики зробили його ефективним інструментом в протистоянні агресору.\nВпроваджуючи власні інноваційні підходи до ведення повітряних та протиповітряних боїв, українські екіпажі демонструють стабільно високі результати під час відбиття атак противника. На рахунку саме F-16 понад 1300 перехоплених повітряних цілей! Зокрема, під час відбиття сьогоднішнього удару пілотами F-16 та Mirage-2000 перехоплено та збито щонайменше 10 ворожих крилатих ракет.\nОкрім місій з протиповітряної оборони, ці літаки активно застосовуються для авіаційної підтримки військ. Пілоти F-16 уразили більше 300 наземних цілей, знищивши сотні одиниць ворожої техніки, командні пункти, пункти управління БпЛА, склади боєприпасів та логістику ворога.\nПілоти F-16 та наземний авіаційний персонал щодоби працюють в надзвичайно складних екстремальних умовах. І єдине, що зараз на думці кожного – безперебійне і своєчасне постачання авіаційних засобів ураження від західних партнерів. Бо без достатньої кількості бомб та ракет F-16 не допоможе перемогти ворога!",
