This city has been on the frontlines for nearly three years, and Russia is on the brink of capturing it. \nRussian forces have rapidly reached the city centre from the north, and are now just 1.5km from the main bridge over the Oskil River connecting the Ukrainian bridgehead on its eastern bank - including in eastern Kupyansk - to the rest of Kharkiv Oblast.\nOnce this highway is cut, all supplies into the pocket will have to go via a bridge to the south in Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi, or over pontoon bridges (although this brings its own separate issues). This creates a bottle neck that can easily be targeted, which will naturally result in the collapse of the bridgehead, the alignment of the front along the river, and a refocusing of efforts to complete the capture of the city and the surrounding areas. \nSupply is already difficult for the AFU in the bridgehead, and the only thing preventing the current Russian assault operations there from achieving breakthroughs is the natural obstacles and significant fortification that lie in Russia's way. \nWhile the fall of Kupyansk may not be imminent, there is a real threat of this northern bridge being cut, which will undoubtably create massive problems for Ukrainian forces in the area.",

The 2 Tu-160s and 3 of the 6 Tu-95s are at Engels-2 Airbase (Saratov Oblast), while the other 3 Tu-95s are at Olenya Airbase (Murmansk Oblast). \nAdditionally, 4-6 Tu-22M3 strategic bombers are equipped with Kh-22 cruise missiles, and ready for use. They are all stationed at Olenya Airbase, and one of these is the one which launched a missile strike on Mykolaiv City a few days ago. Extremely high levels of Tu-22M3 movement have been recorded over the past 4 days. \n5 MiG-31Ks are also equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles, 3 of which are stationed at Savasleika Airbase (Nizhny Novgorod Oblast) and 2 of which are at Akhtubinsk Airbase (Astrakhan Oblast). Not all of these are likely to be used in tomorrow's attack, but the 3 at Savasleika are likely contenders.\nFurthermore, 3 surface carriers and 1 submarine of the \"Varshavyanka\" project are apparently equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, although this information is not confirmed. \nAs for drones, more than 250 Geran-2 drones have been accumulated for launches from several launch locations from multiple directions. Not many were launched today, so tomorrow's numbers are expected to be much larger.",
