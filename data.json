They can launch a maximum of 24 Kalibr cruise missiles.\n- Equipments of Kalibr carriers with missiles at Novorossiysk Naval Base, Kransodar Krai, may also be underway.\n- Additional deliveries of Iskander-M ballistic missiles and Iskander-K cruise missiles to OTRK installations near Ukraine have taken place. \n- Kinzhals launched from MiG-31Ks may also be used, but likely only in conjunction with Kh-101 cruise missiles from strategic bombers. \n- A minimum of 350 Geran-2 drones are expected to be used during this attack.\nIf Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers are used, the highest threat is to the western regions of Ukraine, especially energy infrastructure in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. This would also increase the likelihood of MiG-31K fighters being involved and decrease the chances of Iskander-Ks being used.\nIf strategic bombers aren't used, the highest threat is to the central and northern regions of Ukraine, especially energy and gas infrastructure in Kyiv and Poltava Oblasts.

Iskander-I (Iskander-M with 1,000 range) might be used, but this seems unlikely for the next few weeks.\nInformation continues to be clarified as there have been a lot of inaccurate and conflicting reports recently.",
