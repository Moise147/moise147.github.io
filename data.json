She also stated that both the military personnel and the police officers were under the influence of alcohol.\nThe chase continued into the Zhytomyr region, where police finally blocked the car.

Russia Has Firmly Rejected The Idea Of NATO Peacekeepers\nProposals by European leaders to send military forces into Ukraine have been met with strong opposition from Russia. \n\"All these plans essentially involve providing guarantees through foreign military intervention in part of Ukrainian territory. I very much hope that those hatching such plans are simply trying to attract attention, but I also hope they understand this would be absolutely unacceptable to the Russian Federation,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nEarlier, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, responded more harshly to French President Emmanuel Macron: \n\"The brainless Gallic rooster can't let go of the idea of sending troops to 'Ukraine.' It's been explicitly stated: NO NATO troops as peacekeepers. Russia won't accept such a \"security guarantee.\" But the hoarse, pathetic bird continues to crow to prove it's king of the coop\". \nRead more \nHERE",

Information on such special operations are scarce, and while they are conducted by different Spetsnaz [Russian for special forces] units of the Russian military on a regular basis, they are usually kept under tight wraps.\nThe footage suggests that the night-time raid was carried out by a small squad, all equipped with night vision goggles and silenced assault rifles.\nThe special forces operators took out a few Ukrainian troops who were outside the position, before storming it. They are later seen in the footage clearing nearby trenches and a small underground bunker. Most of the position‚Äôs garrison were killed. Only the few who decided to surrender survived the raid.\nRead more \nHERE",
