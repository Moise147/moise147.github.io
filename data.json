They are likely to take part in any combat sorties. The Tu-95MS and 1 other Tu-160 stationed there are there for training purposes.\n1 frigate of the \"Admiral Makarov\" type, 1 frigate of the \"Admiral Essen\" type, and 1 submarine of the \"Varshavyanka\" type are equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, and stationed at Novorossiysk Naval Base, Krasnodar Krai.
