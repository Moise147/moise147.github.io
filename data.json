They quickly reached Dahdouh Road from the southeast and are now within 1.15 km of the coast. Israeli forces have now taken up positions in a residential quarter (31.50155, 34.42969) in the first part of the partially destroyed coastal Sheikh Ijlin Neighbourhood. \nTo the northeast, the IDF continued pushing from Jabalia at their usual pace and entered into the Gaza Governorate in the area of the Al Sheik Radwan Pool. They began clearing operations towards Gaza City centre from this area, capturing several dense residential blocks (31.52189, 34.4701 & 31.5241, 34.47019), before armoured units began their main vector of attack northwest down Kamal Naser Street. Here they advanced for close to 500 metres, reaching Al-Jala Street, where they expanded for about 240 metres through the dense residential blocks to the southwest (31.52593, 34.46655). \n+ ~1.80 km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",

They were able to quickly clear and capture the outlying streets (31.5529, 34.4642), reaching the edge of the Madinat Al 'Awada Neighbourhood from the north (31.54792, 34.46454). At the same time, other forces captured other key points along the way, including the destroyed Gaza Oil Company complex (31.55287, 34.46791), and the former IDF base at the Gaza Desalination Plant (31.56156, 34.46763). \nTo the southeast, Israeli forces massively intensified their operations in the Nazla Neighbourhood of Jabalia City and cleared a large section of the dense residential zones north of Al-Quds Street, reaching the edge of the Sheik Radwan Neighbourhood of Gaza City (31.53159, 34.47553). \nThe goal here appears to be to isolate remaining Palestinian militant cells in Jabalia Refugee Camp, Jabalia City, Beit Lahiya, and Atatra, so the IDF can focus on establishing a stronger presence in the northern suburbs of Gaza City. \n+ ~2.28 km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",

A large grey zone has formed in the treelines west of the settlement, so it's possible that Ukraine will make attempts at rescuing these soldiers through this. \nHowever, as a result of the local collapse of Ukrainian lines in this area and the subsequent encirclement of Ukrainian troops, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi dismissed Maksym Kituhin, the commander of the 20th Army Corps, from his current position.

After capturing the rest of the Serebryanskyi Forest and beginning the process of consolidation (green), Russian forces began attacking Yampil from multiple directions. \nThe main focus is on the eastern part of the village, where the Russians entered it at three points: \n1. After physically cutting the Dronivka - Yampil Road, they began moving along the road and infiltrating the easternmost houses via the forest (1).\n2. After capturing the Ostrich Farm, Russian forces began entering the eastern streets from the north (2).\n3. After consolidating northwest of the Ostrich Farm, Russian forces entered the railway station, and the houses behind it (3).\nUkrainian forces are heavily shelling all of these points and attempting to counterattack from their positions in the centre of the village towards the eastern streets, where a large grey zone has formed (7). \nIn turn, Russia is shelling the centre and western parts of Yampil and attempting to reach Ukrainian staging grounds in the centre from the railway station. \nFurther west, the Russians are attacking west towards the Yampil - Zarichne Road (4) and the railway crossing (5), where the grey zone has expanded significantly. Ukrainian forces are counterattacking from their forward deployment points in the western part of Yampil, to the area north of the railway crossing (6).",
