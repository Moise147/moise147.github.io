They have since flown north to Olenya Airbase.\n- 3 Tu-95MS are still stationed at Olenya Airbase, alongside the 4 which have returned there, bringing the total concentration of aircraft there to 7.\n- 3 Tu-95MS redeployed from Ukrainka Airbase to Belaya Airbase, Irkutsk Oblast, after being equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles.\n- 2-3 Tu-160 strategic bombers remain equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles at Ukrainka Airbase.\nSo, in short, 10 Tu-95MS and 2-3 Tu-160 strategic bombers are currently equipped with missiles, similar to the attacks carried out in December 2025. \n- Additionally, as I have previously reported, this next attack is likely to include several Iskander-M ballistic missiles, a minimum of 6 Kalibr cruise missiles, and 4-8 Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles. It may also include Iskander-K cruise missiles. \n- A minimum of 400 Geran-2 drones will be used, however this number could be significantly higher considering the current concentrations of drones at launch sites surrounding Ukraine.",
