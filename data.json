He's using them not only against America's numerous geopolitical adversaries, but also vassals and satellite states that he wants to exploit in hopes of reinvigorating the US economy. \nHowever, the last several days of Trump's moves demonstrate his very limited understanding of the geopolitical consequences of such actions. Namely, apart from the ongoing attempts to probe Russia's and¬†China's capabilities through economic warfare, the US government is also targeting India and Brazil (in other words, all four founding member states of what today is¬†the rapidly growing BRICS+ format).\nUsed to cut-throat, swindler tactics of the ruthless American real estate business, Trump believes he can use the \"small carrot, big stick\" approach to resuscitate America's geopolitical dominance...\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",
