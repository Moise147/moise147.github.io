But what's funny is that he can't even get his info about me correct.\nDavid is an American boomer, indoctrinated since birth, who is now spouting his nonsense online to an ever-shrinking audience of comfort-media-consumers. He's someone that you should never take seriously, unless you like being lied to.\nBut don't worry, his grift will be over soon.
