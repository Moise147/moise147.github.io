They pushed west from the area of Levadne, and advanced down several treelines on the tactical heights, as well as down the northern bank of the Solona River in the direction of Olhivske. \nTo the north, they expanded their wedge in Zaporizhzhia Oblast from Novodarivka, pushing southwest and uphill to the tactical heights, as well as west - further down the forest plantations in the low-lying ground. They also improved their positions on the tactical heights to the north, by attacking southwest from the Temyrivka - Zelene Pole road.\nFurther north, after capturing Temryivka, Russian forces advanced uphill and northwest towards Zaporizke, capturing new treeline positions and approaching its outskirts from two directions. They also spearheaded north along the Dnipropetrovsk side of the regional border to Novoheorhiivka, quickly establishing control over the village and forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the adjacent positions. \nAdvances were also made between the Vorona River and a tributary of the Vorona River in Donetsk Oblast, where they were able to push downhill towards Komyshuvakha, while further improving their positions southwest and west of Shevchenko. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to bypass the rest of Maliivka from the north, moving along the heights, and capturing the agricultural buildings as well as the western part of the village, reaching the low-lying ground south of Sichneve. \n+ ~54.9km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They were able to clear the eastern bank of the Vovcha River south of Andriivka-Klevtsove of a Russian presence and began advancing towards Piddubne. \nThey were able to make a deep 6.5km penetration through Russian lines along the highway and turned north to clear the orchards and surrounding treelines.

After fierce back-and-forth fighting, they were able to seize the agricultural buildings and surrounding treelines on the outskirts of Zelenyi Hai, before entering and capturing the northern part of the settlement. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces advanced north from the Yalta - Novokhatske Line, reaching the southern bank of the Vovcha River and taking up new positions in the forest plantations there. \n+ ~32.10km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~4.23km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
