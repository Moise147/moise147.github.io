The Russians were able to capture the Svyatohirsk Water Treatment Facility and gained a foothold in the forests of the national park. Due to a critical lack of manpower in this direction, Ukrainian forces put up limited resistance as the Russians advanced through the forests on multiple axes. \nRussian forces advanced west through the forests towards the Sosnove - Oleksandrivka Railway Line and Road and are rapidly approaching it. They are also advancing down the road to western Yarova, and captured new positions in the forests there. Additionally, the Russian soldiers who infiltrated southeastern Yarova were forced to withdraw after meeting fierce resistance from the Ukrainian garrison there and instead began attacks towards the village from forested areas further west. \nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their counterattacks in the village of Ridkodub. As a result of intensified attacks, they were able to recapture the agricultural buildings on the northern outskirts of the settlement, while the Russians largely pulled back to its easternmost street.\n+ ~7.09 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.\n+ ~0.50 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

They were able to take the poorly consolidated Russian positions there and used them to push further into the treelines southeast and east of Kindrashivka. \nUkrainian armoured vehicles were able to advance further, and approached the western bank of the Oskil River, but were subsequently destroyed by FPV drones. Most of the infantry in the vehicles were killed shortly afterwards, and the chances of consolidation in these areas is next to zero. Nevertheless, Russian logistics into Kupyansk have been complicated. While all supply was already being carried out on foot through fields and forests, this shortening of the gap that can be used will make things more difficult and could delay the eventual fall of the city. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued to advance in Kupyansk itself.

This allowed for the Russians to break out of the village and take up new positions in the forest and treelines to the south. \nFrom there, a new incursion was made across the border in the direction of Bolohivka.
