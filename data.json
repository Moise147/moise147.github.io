They advanced along two opposite tactical heights, as well as through a gulley, and reached the northern edge of the Popiv Yar Chalk Quarry. Ukrainian soldiers have also been attempting to infiltrate into northern Novotoretske in small groups.  \nRussian forces continued to recapture previously lost positions on the western flank of their salient after the Ukrainians failed to cut them off. They advanced west to the eastern outskirts of Nove Shakhove, capturing treeline positions, and re-entered the northern part of the Hektova Balka Gulley. They also continued to attack west through Nykanorivka.\nAdditionally, the frontline was corrected further west. Sometime in the past 3 weeks, Russia was able to recapture the village of Doroznje and the freight train station of the same name, entrenching in positions there. Due to a lack of positions, Ukrainian forces withdrew over 3 km west, resulting in a large grey zone forming covered by Ukrainian FPV drones. Russian DRGs are actively operating here, attempting to reach the ventilation shafts for the Bilytska Coal Mine (where the current forwards Ukrainian positions are), and have entered the northeastern and eastern streets of Bilytske where Ukrainian forces have been trying to clear them out. \n+ ~14.80 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine. \n+ ~3.64 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

Battles are ongoing there, as the Russians continue to expand their zone of control to the east and west. \nTo the east, Russian forces advanced south to the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, reaching its intersection with the Zherebets River, and taking up new positions in the forests there. \n+ ~7.21 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
