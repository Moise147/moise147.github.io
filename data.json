They then entered Sichneve from the north, and established control over the northern part of the village, as well as the nearby treelines on the tactical heights.

Meanwhile, in the western suburbs of Pokrovsk, their zone of control shrunk after they failed to consolidate in the Durniak District, however, infiltration attempts continue in the Durniak and Pervomaika Districts, where Ukrainian forces are increasingly using FPV drones to contain their advance. \nOn the other hand, Russian forces withdrew from the Market District of Pokrovsk, allowing for the Ukrainians to regain control over the eastern market and surrounding residential areas. \n+ ~3.89 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.\n+ ~0.39 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",
