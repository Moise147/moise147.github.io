Here they will probably be equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles, as Belaya Airbase hasn't been used for equipment of missile since Ukraine's operation spiderweb on June 1, 2025. \nAdditionally, 1 Tu-95MS departed from Olenya Airbase and is still airborne. The purpose of the flight is currently unclear, but it might be conducting training with simulated launch maneuvers. \nThe two Tu-95s that redeployed from Olenya Airbase to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast, on August 31 are still there being equipped with missiles. Once they return, the total number of equipped aircraft stationed at Olenya and Engels-2 Airbases will rise to 6 (4 Tu-95s and 2 Tu-160s).",
