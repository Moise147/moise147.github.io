Now Trump and Putin have agreed to meet in Alaska on August 15, meaning that it's unlikely that this attack will take place any time before August 17 so as not to tarnish Russia's image of seeking a peaceful resolution to the war. \nHowever, Russia has not been quiet behind the scenes. Accumulation of Geran-2 drones, Kh-101 cruise missiles, and Iskander-M ballistic missiles has been taking place.\nSince the last combined missile attack 13 days ago on July 28, 7 IL-76MD military transport aircraft have made flights to Engels-2 Airbase in Saratov Oblast, which is the main airbase used for equipping Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers. 4 Tu-95s are currently stationed at Engels-2, and have been there for over four days, which is a very rare phenomenon recently for this base. Three of these bombers have been conducting nightly training for young pilots, while one is undergoing active maintenance. \nAs for Gerans, very few have been launched over the past 5 days, with no more than 50 per night. While it may seem like a lot from the reports, the vast majority of them are Gerbera drones, which have no warhead and aim to waste and further overwhelm Ukrainian air defence. This means that Gerans are being accumulated at the different launch points for usage in the next combined missile attacks. \nIskanders have also not been used much lately, with some days not witnessing a single strike. This also indicates accumulation, especially in Voronezh, Bryansk and Rostov Oblasts.",

They exert partial civil control over the Areas A and B of the West Bank, but have no presence in the Gaza Strip, which was under full control of the Hamas political party (and still partially is). \nThe PA is funded by Israel to maintain security in areas of the West Bank not permanently occupied by the IDF, and they collaborate with Shin Bet and the IDF both in military activity and intelligence gathering, often against militant cells operating in the West Bank's refugee camps.",
