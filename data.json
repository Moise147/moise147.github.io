This number is massive for such a short period of time and shows the profound level of crisis within the Ukrainian military. In fact, this is the highest number of desertions reported in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, which also indicates that more recently the conditions of the war have become increasingly intolerable...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
