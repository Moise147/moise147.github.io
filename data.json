This allowed for them to finally entrench in around half of Prylipka after weeks of unsuccessful assaults, and capture positions in the forests to the south. Additionally, the Russians improved their positions in the forests southwest of Lyman in the direction of the Hrafske - Symynivka Road. \nMeanwhile, additional Ukrainian reinforcements were redeployed to this sector, who are now carrying out intensified counterattacks on Russian positions in southern Vilcha and southern Lyman. So far, the attacks on Vilcha have been unsuccessful and no confirmed advances have been made in Lyman. \nIn the northeast, Russian forces continued incrementally advancing through Vovchanski-Khutory and captured most of the central part of the village. Fighting is ongoing for additional residential streets there.\n+ ~4.60 km² in favour of Russia. \nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

These positions were used by Ukrainian drone operators and contained repeaters for FPV drones used to attack border regions of Belgorod Oblast, including the town of Krasnaya Yaruga.

Other assault groups advanced from the treelines to the northwest, capturing additional positions further south down the road.
