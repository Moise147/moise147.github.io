After consolidating northwest of the Ostrich Farm, Russian forces entered the railway station, and the houses behind it (3).\nUkrainian forces are heavily shelling all of these points and attempting to counterattack from their positions in the centre of the village towards the eastern streets, where a large grey zone has formed (7). \nIn turn, Russia is shelling the centre and western parts of Yampil and attempting to reach Ukrainian staging grounds in the centre from the railway station. \nFurther west, the Russians are attacking west towards the Yampil - Zarichne Road (4) and the railway crossing (5), where the grey zone has expanded significantly.
