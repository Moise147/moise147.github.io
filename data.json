Its currently unclear as to why they flew here rather than to Engels-2. \nOver the last week, at least 3 IL-76MD cargo planes landed at Engels-2 Airbase. 1-2 of these planes carried Kh-101 cruise missiles, which will likely be equipped to the Tu-95MS.\nAt least 4 Tu-22m3 strategic bombers are equipped with Kh-22 cruise missiles at Olenya Airbase. This is what the 3rd IL-76MD was transporting to Engels-2 Airbase.\n4-6 MiG-31K fighters have been equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles at Savasleika Airbase and have been carrying out active training missions over the past week, including with simulated launches. \nIskander-M ballistic missiles have been delivered to OTRK installations near Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, and Liski, Voronezh Oblast. Deliveries to other areas has also likely been carried out.\nIt's likely (not 100% confirmed) that 1 \"Varshavyanka\" submarine, 1 \"Admiral Makarov\" Frigate, and 1 \"Buyan-M\" Corvette have been equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles at Novorossiysk Naval Base.\nAccumulation of Geran-2 and Gerbera drones continues at all major launch points surrounding Ukraine. \nActivity on frequencies used by strategic aviation at Ukrainka Airbase suggests that redeployments of Tu-160 strategic bombers will likely take place tonight/tomorrow. \nThere will not be an attack tonight, but the increased threat is for the nights of November 29/30, and November 30/December 1.",
