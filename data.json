      "original": "Ukrainian Thriller: Drunken TRC and Police Officers Pursue Family with Children\nAn incident in Ukraine‚Äôs Vinnytsia region starkly illustrates the extreme tensions in Ukrainian society amid the ongoing mobilization. Officers from the Territorial Recruitment Center (TRC), together with police officers, initiated a pursuit of a passenger car whose driver ignored an order to stop near the village of Kasperivka. \nAccording to the driver‚Äôs wife, the reason for the refusal to stop was that they were being signaled to stop by a man in military uniform, not a police officer, who then immediately began hitting their vehicle.

Russia Has Firmly Rejected The Idea Of NATO Peacekeepers\nProposals by European leaders to send military forces into Ukraine have been met with strong opposition from Russia. \n\"All these plans essentially involve providing guarantees through foreign military intervention in part of Ukrainian territory. I very much hope that those hatching such plans are simply trying to attract attention, but I also hope they understand this would be absolutely unacceptable to the Russian Federation,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nEarlier, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, responded more harshly to French President Emmanuel Macron: \n\"The brainless Gallic rooster can't let go of the idea of sending troops to 'Ukraine.'
