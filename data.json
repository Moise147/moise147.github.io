In Pokrovsk itself, fighting continues and activity of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the southern suburbs remains high. A lack of manpower and less experienced units in Pokrovsk complicates the identification and destruction of Russian DRGs and assault units, which resulted in the break down of the solid line of contact that we‚Äôve witnessed. \nThe situation in Myrnohrad is better for the AFU, with more experienced units and less of a manpower problem resulting in less Russian success, and as such, Russian assault units are yet to enter the city, with entries currently limited to DRGs. Most of the pressure on Myrnohrad is being exerted from the direction of Novoeconomichne, which has largely come under Russian control, with a solidified Russian presence forming west of the Kazenyi Torets River. \nA lack of Russian consolidation east of Rodynske, and Ukrainian counterattacks which resulted in them breaking through to and recapturing Razine, resulted in a decrease in the intensity of Russian attacks from Novoeconomichne, and a focus on complicating their positions in the surrounding areas. Although, new reports suggest that Ukrainian successes at Razine are already being reversed. Despite this, steady Russian advances continue to be made in the vicinity of Fedorivka and Nykanorivka further north, continuing the expansion of the wedge towards the rest of Shakhove.",
