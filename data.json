I have highlighted these instances it in the attached image if you wish to take a closer look.\nAdditionally, if you look closer at their channel, their maps are just edited versions of \n@Suriyak_maps\n' maps, with large grey zones present.\nYou would think that an account so connected with an army group who posts updates so often would have their own information, and wouldn't regurgitate information posted by a pro-Ukrainian account like me?\nIt's likely that this account is a fraud, so if you are looking for updates on this direction, please don't treat it as reliable, and especially don't treat it as a \"Russian source\".
