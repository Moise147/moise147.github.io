A total of 38 attack UAVs were launched over Ukraine, and 17 over Russia.\nRegarding the deployment of drone technology, Western combat UAVs supplied to Ukraine are reported to be failing to meet battlefield expectations. Assessments indicate they are too costly and vulnerable to Russian electronic warfare systems.

The core issues are identified as a combination of high cost, low survivability, and a lack of sufficient adaptation to the conditions of modern combat.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
