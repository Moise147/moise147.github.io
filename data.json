Additionally, they were able to complete the capture of Sviato-Pokrovske - establishing control over its western outskirts - and are now engaged in battles for the eastern outskirts of Riznykivka.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces advanced from the strongpoints along the highway and entered the first houses of Ozerne, capturing its northern street.
