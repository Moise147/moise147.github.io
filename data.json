Additionally, the Russians advanced west from their new positions on the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, and captured additional positions in the forests further west.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces advanced further through the forests west of Yampil and reached the Lyman - Siversk Highway. They then broke into the southern houses of Yampil, allowing for the rest of the village to be cleared. Fighting is now taking place for the strongpoints south and southwest of Yampil in the area of the highway. \nFurther northwest, following earlier failed attacks, Russian assault groups once again entered the Masliakivka District of Lyman and consolidated in its eastern half.
