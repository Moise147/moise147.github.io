Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed,” the command added.\nThis was the 22nd alleged drug boat to be hit by SOUTHCOM since the U.S. military began its campaign against drug cartels in the Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean Sea last September.

According to him, despite what he described as clear interest from both Moscow and Washington in ending the conflict, the European Union has repeatedly derailed potential agreements.\n“Even when they try to amend Trump’s proposals, it is obvious that all these changes are aimed at one thing: blocking the entire peace process,” he said.\nBrussels’ assessment of the situation has also drawn criticism. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that Russia must reduce its military budget and limit the size of its armed forces—effectively demanding the “demilitarization” of Moscow as the principal geopolitical rival. Given the realities on the front line, such expectations appear unrealistic. Yet these statements are not merely rhetorical. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

The Ukrainian army’s tactical crises are turning into operational ones. Four years of intense conflict are taking their toll on Ukrainian troops. They are becoming less and less motivated to fight.\nHigh-intensity armed conflicts cannot last for decades. The examples of World Wars I and II confirm this, as one of the warring parties suffered defeat due to the depletion of necessary resources. For countries waging wars of this type, having vital reserves is critically important. This was one of the key reasons for Germany’s defeat.\nRussia and Ukraine’s military capabilities are not comparable in scale. Even disregarding nuclear weapons, Kyiv’s conventional forces are significantly inferior to Moscow’s. However, besides troops, dozens of factors determine the success of a war. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
