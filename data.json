The Ukrainian army’s tactical crises are turning into operational ones. Four years of intense conflict are taking their toll on Ukrainian troops. They are becoming less and less motivated to fight.\nHigh-intensity armed conflicts cannot last for decades.

For countries waging wars of this type, having vital reserves is critically important. This was one of the key reasons for Germany’s defeat.\nRussia and Ukraine’s military capabilities are not comparable in scale. Even disregarding nuclear weapons, Kyiv’s conventional forces are significantly inferior to Moscow’s.
