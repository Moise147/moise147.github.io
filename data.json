They were also able to secure the treeline running north of the gulley, connecting this bridgehead with the larger front further north.\nTo the south, after consolidating in the agricultural complex, Russian forces pushed into the northern part of the forest north of Novoselivka, and began attacking west towards the larger forest. Other forces advanced over the Nitrius River, and established control over all of northern Novoselivka. These assault groups began pushing north to the first forest, squeezing the Ukrainians out from their positions against the western bank of the large reservoir. From there, they began pushing further west through the forests, with extensive FPV drone strikes working on the Ukrainian positions, supply routes, and distribution points ahead of them. Further south, assault operations began towards the centre of Novoselivka, where the grey zone has expanded. \nIn the southeast, Russian forces continued to incrementally advance south down the Shandryholove - Drobysheve Road, and have now branched off onto the perpendicular treeline on the northern approaches to Drobysheve. Further east, after prolonged heavy fighting, the Russians broke through the remaining Ukrainian positions in the forests east of Derylove, and with help from forces in the western houses of the settlement, managed to squeeze the Ukrainians out of the centre, before occupying the positions in the forest plantations directly south of the village. \nAdditionally, Russian forces began a coordinated effort to secure the northeastern approaches to Drobysheve. Attacks were carried out towards the next treeline over from Derylove. Once this was occupied, they began storming Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley from the west, and the foothold from the northeast, where heavy battles are still ongoing. \n+ ~9.19 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

The newly captured positions in this forest were then used as staging grounds to advance to, and capture positions in the southern houses of Zariche. These positions have since been linked up to the initial Russian bridgehead over the Zherebets River in southeastern Zarichne, resulting in large parts of the grey zone being cleared and a salient forming. Ukrainian forces are still moving in and out of the grey zone via the industrial zone in the southwest of the village, but Russia's grip on this area is becoming increasingly tight.\nFurther north, Russian forces finally cleared out the rest of northern Zarichne, and occupied the Ukrainian positions in the agricultural buildings on the western outskirts. From there, they began pushing northwest through the forests up the gulley and have almost cut off the Ukrainian garrison in Myrne. Attacks were also carried out up the western bank of the Zherebets River, as well to the trenches on the northern edge of Myrne. \nIn the northwest, Russian forces resumed their assault operations towards Stavky from the northeast and were able to capture new positions in three separate treelines.\n+ ~9.51 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

From there, they are infiltrating towards the chalk quarry east of Dronivka. As a result of this, Ukraine was forced to withdraw from the village of Serebryanka, and is now holding a defence from three sides in Dronivka. Russian forces have also recaptured the rest of Serebryanka, as well as the surrounding positions, and are now trying to permanently establish themselves in the chalk quarry. \nThe Russians were also able to fully secure the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, aligning the front along the Donetsk - Luhansk Regional Border, and officially ending the battles for the Severodonetsk District of Luhansk Oblast which have been ongoing since the first days of the war. \nTo the west, Russian forces marginally advanced towards Dronivka from the west, securing new positions in the forest on the western bank of the Siverskyi Donets River. \nIn the west, Russian forces continued their offensive on Yampil. They were able to consolidate control over additional positions in the eastern part of the village, including at the railway station, and are continuing their attacks beyond the village centre (which is currently in the grey zone).

From there, they entered eastern Verbove with little resistance and occupied at least half of the village, including the agricultural buildings. The intensity of FAB glide-bomb strikes in this area is increasing, with Ukrainian temporary deployment points and fortifications constantly being struck.\nAdditionally, Russian forces advanced north from their positions west of Berezove, and captured the one-house \"village\" of Stepove.
