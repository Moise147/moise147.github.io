Immediately after completing the capture of Zarichne, Russian forces went on to advance west of the village down the gulley leading to the large forests further west.

Additionally, an unsuccessful Ukrainian counterattack involving an APC was made towards the industrial zone, with the goal of preventing Russian consolidation in the southwestern part of Zarichne. At the same time, Ukraine has intensified their FPV drone strikes on Torske, as well as general Russian supply lines.\nFurther south, Russian forces continued to slowly push through the Yampil Forest and have advanced by approximately 700 metres.
