      "original": "Today, the IDF officially confirmed the beginning of their offensive to clear Gaza City. I'd like to give some context regarding this. \nMany people seem to believe that Israel will be \"entering\" Gaza City today, but in reality, they have been operating within the city limits since March, and as Israel begins their offensive, they control approximately 46% of the city. \nAfter Israel largely withdrew from Gaza city in 2024 to focus on the cities of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun to the north, and then from the Netzarim corridor during the ceasefire period in early 2025, many Gazans returned to their homes in the city. Unlike cities like Rafah, Gaza City was damaged but not flattened, meaning that it still had infrastructure for a large population. \nBut after Israel broke the ceasefire in March, they restarted their operations in the city and began clearing the eastern Shujaiyya, Kuba, and Al-Tuffah neighbourhoods which lie on higher ground overlooking Israel's border settlements. This meant that they were home to some of Al-Qassam's (Hamas) elite units. Due to the topography of the area, its proximity to the border, and the known substantial presence of militants, Israel aimed to create a buffer zone from the border. Over a period of several months, they slowly pushed deeper and deeper through the neighbourhoods, facing resistance in the form of ambushes, rocket attacks, and mortar shellings. However, a lack of coordination between militant cells, higher-quality equipment, and manpower, decreased the effectiveness of these attacks. Nevertheless, it ensured the IDF was more cautious and patient when clearing and demolishing the neighbourhoods, especially due to the known presence of some of the surviving elite Palestinian forces. \nLast month, the IDF began a new series of attacks on the Al-Zeitoun neighbourhood, which included an unprecedented speed of demolition operations. This increased the percentage of the city that they controlled and largely eliminated one of the areas that Hamas and other groups had a relatively large presence there, further pressuring their overall presence in the city. This, combined with intensified operations in central Jabalia could result in a \"squeezing\" effect, where Israeli forces close in from three sides and isolate parts of the city to clear separately. \nAs for evacuations, the IDF stated that over 250,000 civilians have fled south, which they claim equates to approximately 40% of the city's population at the time.  I suspect that a portion of Palestinian militants in the city also fled south to the central camps (Nuseirat, Maghazi, and Bureij) and the city of Deir Al-Balah, which contain some of the only areas Israel has not operated in yet during the course of this war. As a result, they are generally safer and hold more coordinated and substantial presences of fighters.\nBefore anyone starts commenting about me \"whitewashing\" a genocide, I'd like to say that this post is looking at the war purely from a military standpoint (war and genocide are not mutually exclusive). There is obviously a lot more to this offensive (and the war in general), but that is a whole other story.",

This militarization extends for reasons beyond the fight against drug trafficking and increasing crime, and serves as a warning against mass illegal migration. Although crime in Brussels, the unofficial capital of the European Union and headquarters of NATO, saw a decline by 2011, it rose rapidly again in 2020 and 2023, coinciding with the mass arrival of illegal immigrants to Europe in 2015, leaving the country‚Äôs authorities no choice but to finally announce a crackdown.\nBelgian Minister of Security and Home Affairs Bernard Quintin announced a new security plan last week that includes the deployment of soldiers alongside police in the country‚Äôs major cities, with special attention to areas considered sensitive, such as metro stations and troubled neighborhoods.\nRead more \nHERE",
