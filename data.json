The full extent of this breakthrough remains unknown, but DRGs are operating on the outskirts of both Hryshyne and Novooleksandrivka. This makes the second to last road out of Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad unusable.\nDorozhnje and the freight train station of the same name have been occupied after over a week of battles, along with Ivanivka and Nove Shakhove to the north. \nDRGs continue to operate in and around Novyi Donbas  and on the approaches to Dobropillya. No new DRG activity within Dobropillya's city limits has been recorded over the past 12 hours. \nThe 12th \"Azov\" Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine was deployed to Rubizhne (circled in green), which has prevented it's capture. Nevertheless, Zolotyi  Kolodyaz - the focus of the initial media frenzy - has come under Russian control. DRGs continue to operate on the approaches to Hruzke. \nRussian forces captured the Krasnolymanskaya Mine and the adjacent terykon. They also secured part of eastern Rodynske and made additional progress in Chervonyi Lyman. \nNovoekonomichne has come under Russian control, and progress was made northwest of Hrodivka and west of Myrolyubivka. \nThe rest of Lysivka has moved into the grey zone, with unconfirmed reports of its capture. Suhkyi Yar and the guitar-shaped fortification continue to hold.\nRussian forces continue to push north through western Pokrovsk and completed the capture of Leontovychi.\nPositions were improved in northern Kotlyne and east of the village.\nSouthern Udachne and the town's train station was captured by Russian forces. Most of the rest of the town is a kill-zone or in the grey zone. \nThe remaining Ukrainian soldiers in Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, and the surrounding villages are about to be encircled if nothing is done very soon. Only one road remains even slightly safe for a withdrawal to take place. \nI will make a full and more accurate map update tomorrow, but I thought I should share these developments sooner rather than later.",

DRGs has already been operating here, and by this time were 8km to the west on the outskirts of Novooleksandrivka and Hryshyne. \nRussian forces continued to advance west, moving across the tactical heights, and seizing positions in the treelines northwest of Rodynske. Keep in mind, the true scale of this advance may be further than is shown. \nTo the south, around a week ago Russian forces established full control over the Krasnolymanskaya Mine and its terykon, giving them far more surveillance over Rodynske and the surrounding areas. From there, they were able to advance west, past the smaller terykon, and entered eastern Rodynske. Positions were taken up in both high-rise buildings and in the private sector. Additional progress was also made in Chervonyi Lyman, with Russian forces approaching southeastern Rodynske from the east. Most of the village is now under Russian control.\nIn the north, Russian forces managed to enter the Ukrainian strongpoints at Dorozhnje, and by utilising the newly recapturing positions in the forests to the east, managed to capture the village and its freight train station. They were also able to capture Ivanivka, and complete the capture of Nove Shakhove. \n+ ~27.33km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
