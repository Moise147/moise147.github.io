In the east, they cleared out most of the remaining Ukrainian positions in the salient northwest of Oleksiivka, advancing downhill from the tactical heights. They were able to cross the border into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, capturing most of a treeline heading west.\nTo the southwest, Russian forces expanded their zone of control in Donetsk Oblast, capturing positions along three different treelines and reaching the regional border.\nTo the west, Russian forces advanced further northwest from Dachne in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, establishing control over a forest and nearby forest plantations in the low-lying ground. They were also able to re-secure the western part of Yalta and secured the treelines northeast of Zirka. \nIn the west, Russian forces advanced from their foothold in the southeastern houses of Zelenyi Hai, expanding outwards and clearing the rest of the residential part of the village. They then pushed further west, capturing the farm buildings and positions in the adjacent treelines. \n+ ~30.39km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
