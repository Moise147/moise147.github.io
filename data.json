Individual, separated blocks have been cleared, which are being used to push deeper and encircle other blocks. East of Al-Jala Street, the IDF continued to clear the dense residential blocks towards Gaza City Centre and penetrate southwest through the Al-Daraj Neighbourhood. \nIn the area of Jabalia Al-Balad (advance 2), the IDF continued clearing the old city and surrounding neighbourhood. Armoured units also entered the Sheikh Radwan Neighbourhood of Gaza City via Al-Saftawy Street, establishing themselves in residential buildings on either side of the street, as well as in the blocks further north.\nIn the Nazla and Ebad Al-Rahman neighbourhoods of Jabalia City, Israeli forces advanced north to the intersection of Al-Saftawy and Al-Bahr streets, and pushed into the high-rise residential blocks to the east and west. \nIn the Al-Karamah Neighbourhood (advance 4) Israeli forces continued to rapidly push through the largely destroyed residential areas near the coast and reached Ebad Al-Rahman Neighbourhood from the northwest, which is the only non-cleared area connecting Gaza City with Northern Gaza. They also advanced into the Port Gaza neighbourhood from the north, capturing previously destroyed residential blocks. \n+ ~2.92 km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",
