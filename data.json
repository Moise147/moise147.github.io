      "original": "(PART 1)\n \nAnalysis on the situation in the Kostyantynivka direction and Russian plans to take the city:\nOver the last two months, the Russian command has deployed significant reinforcements to the Kostyantynivka direction, in what appears to be an attempt to properly set themselves up for the capture of Kostyantynivka city. \nA few days ago, Russian infantry from the 10th Tank Regiment carried out a 5km-deep infiltration into the village of Illinivka, west of Kostyantynivka, in what appears to be the first move to collapse Ukrainian defences outside the city. \nFor some time, the Russian forces (apparently primarily consisting of forces from the 72nd Motor Rifle Brigade, and possibly supported by elements of the 78th \"Akhmat\" Motor Rifle Regiment) attempting to establish a large foothold in the eastern part of the city have been hindered by a lack of progress by neighbouring units on the flanks. On their right flank, the 77th Motor Rifle Regiment and 89th Tank Regiment, supported by elements of the 1008th and 1442nd Motor Rifle Regiments, have struggled to make progress in the area of Predtechyne and Stupochky, despite earlier deep infiltration by DRGs into the large forests east of Kostyanytynivka. On their left flank, despite earlier successes, the 4th, 78th, 103rd, and 1194th Motor Rifle Regiments have become bogged down in the fields west of Pleshchiivka and Ivanopillya, and are struggling to consolidate due to heavy Ukrainian drone usage on their supply routes. \nThe Russian command seems to have attempted to solve this issue on the flanks by carrying/planning to carry out two concerted operations: \nOn the right flank, soldiers 10th Tank Regiment achieved a localised breakthrough in the direction of Illinivka, which saw them break through the Ukrainian drone kill-zone in the area of the highway intersection, and scattered infantry throughout the village. At the same time, other assault groups of the 10th Tank Regiment are advancing through the kill-zones in the western part of the forest north of the Kleban-Bykske Reservoir to infiltrate the southern outskirts of Berestok, which had previously proven unsuccessful for them. This appears to be a coordinated effort to push past the kill-zones and force the Ukrainian formations stubbornly defending the rest of the forest and the areas northwest of Ivanopillya to withdraw to the north, thereby freeing up the 4th, 78th, 103rd, and 1194th regiments to clear the rest of the areas south of the city, and further developing the left flank of the main push towards the centre of Kostyantynivka. \nThis effort is also being supported by the 54th, 1436th, and 1219th Motor Rifle Regiments in the area of Stepanivka, who have - over the last 2 months - incrementally approached the village from the south and west, and are attempting to consolidate and accumulate for attacks directly into the settlement which currently remains firmly under Ukrainian control. If the 10th Tank Regiment is able to consolidate in Illinivka and bring in supplies, this could develop a left flank for them and force the remaining Ukrainian units stubbornly defending the forests northeast of Yablunivka to withdraw north. \nHowever, currently I doubt their ability to successfully bring in adequate supplies to Illinivka due to the depth of the incursion zone, and the kill-zones which are still in place from Ukrainian drones in the area of the highway intersection. Currently, heavy Ukrainian bomber drones are focusing on carrying out strikes on Russian infantry in the northern part of Illinivka. From there, they will probably intensify strikes on the southern part of the village. It's likely - in my opinion - that Ukrainian assault groups will subsequently clear out the village to try to save the situation, as it's very clear the implications that a successful Russian capture of the village would have for the overall defence of Kostyantynivka.",

      "original": "(PART 2) \nAnalysis on the situation in the Kostyantynivka direction and Russian plans to take the city\n:\nAlthough, it is possible that the Russians will be able to at least secure the forested gulley southwest of Illinivka first, and use this in the future for additional attempts to capture the village\nAs for the right flank of the 72nd Regiment, no major increases in Russian attacks have been observed. Currently, the main vector of attack is along the highway from Stupochky to the large forests east of Kostyantynivka, however no significant success has been recorded yet. Recently, the Russian command redeployed the 70th Motor Rifle Division to the Kostyantynivka direction. In my opinion, this is being done in an attempt to solve the problem on the right flank of the city, in coordination with the recent attacks on Illinivka. Prior to this redeployment, the 28th Motor Rifle Regiment of the 70th Division was already operating in Chasiv Yar, where they have faced problems from Ukrainian incursions into the southwestern part of the city in October (which they have only managed to recapture around half of) and the strong defences in the neighbouring village of Mykolaivka. It's highly likely that the rest of the 70th Division has been redeployed to Bakhmut, where the 24th and 26th Motor Rifle Regiments, along with the 17th Tank Regiment will again attempt to properly develop the right flank of the city.  \nHowever, as these preparations take place, actions are already underway on the extreme right flank of the city in the area of Virolyubivka and Mykolaivka. Here, the 126th and 127th Motor Rifle Regiments have been making incremental progress over the last 3 months, successfully creating a large \"ledge\" northeast of Kostyantynivka. This will likely serve as a springboard for attacks on the Stinky - Klynove line, with the goal of enveloping the strong Ukrainian defences in the area of Mykolaivka, Chervone, and Podilske, which would eventually collapse remaining Ukrainian defences northeast of the city. \nOverall, the Russian command appears to be implementing a comprehensive plan to take Kostyantynivka (Whose pre-war population exceeds that of Pokrovsk) in a timely manner. If this succeeds, it will prevent Russian forces from engaging in an extremely prolonged and costly battle for this large city, and allow them to coordinate properly with adjacent offensives in the directions of Dobropillya and Slovyansk.",
