Netanyahu has agreed to this plan, and Hamas has stated that they are looking over it. \nThe plan includes the following main points:\n1: Gaza will be a \"terror-free\" zone, meaning that militants from Hamas, and organisations fighting alongside Hamas such as the PIJ, PFLP, DFLP, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, etc, would have to leave the strip.\n2. Gaza will be \"redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza\". \n3. The war will immediately end in all sectors, including artillery and air bombardment. IDF forces will withdraw to the yellow line shown on the map. (Please note that the current control line shown on Trump's map is completely wrong). A staged withdrawal will begin once conditions are met. \n4. 72 hours later, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be handed over to Israel.\n5. After the hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners, as well as 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th, 2023, including all women and children. Additionally, for every Israeli hostage whose body is released, Israel will release the bodies of 15 deceases Gazans. \n6. After the hostage exchanges, all Hamas members who commit to \"peaceful co-existence\" and to decommission their weapons will be allowed safe passage out of the Gaza Strip to receiving countries. It is unknown if this will include members from other, Hamas-aligned organisations in Gaza. \n7. Full aid will then be sent to the Gaza Strip without interference, through the UN and its agencies, the red crescent, and other international institutions not associated with either party. The Rafah Border Crossing will also be opened, which the map below shows would be under IDF occupation.\n8. Gaza will be governed under a temporary, transitional government. It will be made up of \"qualified Palestinians\" and international experts and supervised by a new international transitional body headed by Trump. \n9. The Palestinian Authority will undergo a reform program. Once it has completed this, it will regain control over the Gaza Strip.\n10. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, but those who wish to can move to and from the strip.\n11. All military-related infrastructure in the Gaza Strip will be demolished and not rebuilt. \n12. The UN will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy to Gaza. It will train and provide support to Palestinian police forces in Gaza, as well as help secure Gaza's borders. \n13. The IDF will remain in the small perimeter zone shown on the map until Gaza is properly secured from any resurgence. \n14. An \"interfaith dialogue\" process will be established to change the mindsets of Palestinians and Israelis towards peace and co-existence. \n15. While Gaza is redeveloping and the PA is carrying out its reform program, there is a possibility for the recognition of a Palestinian state.",
