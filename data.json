Other assault groups pushed north through the treelines and forested areas further east and reached the gulley running southwest from Riznykivka.\nAdditionally, following earlier infiltrations, Russian forces cleared the rest of Kuzmynivka which was abandoned by the Ukrainians due to additional Russian advances through the treelines to the north, outflanking it. From there, in coordination with attacks from Sviato-Pokrovske, the Russians managed to collapse the Ukrainian lines south of Sviato-Pokrovske, fully capturing the tactical heights there and aligning the front with the gulley to the west. \nTo the north, Russian forces consolidated in the eastern houses of Riznykivka. They also continued advancing along the tactical heights north of the Sukha River, consolidating in additional forests and breaking through to the northern part of Riznykivka.\nFurther north, the Russians continued expanding their zone of control in the fields west of Siversk. They secured the rest of the forested gulleys and established control over the surrounding treelines, advancing towards the southern end of the gulley leading south from Zakitne. Other assault groups continued advancing south down the gulley from Zakitne, and cleared the treeline positions to the east.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces cleared the rest of eastern Zakitne and began attacks on the central part of the settlement. They managed to infiltrate the village from the forests to the northeast and entrenched in the central houses. Fighting is ongoing for areas further west.\nIn the northwest, Russian forces continued to incrementally advance in and around Ozerne, clearing most of the rest of the forests north of the village. They also managed to marginally advance in its western houses.\n+ ~43.41 km² in favour of Russia.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

This forced the remaining Ukrainian formations to withdraw from the rest of their strongholds in the high-rise buildings, which in turn allowed for the Russians to collapse their lines and capture large parts of the remaining low-rise residential areas.\nSince then, Russian forces have begun attacking the industrial zone on the western edge of Hulyaipole, and have captured most of the rest of the residential streets.\nThis collapse, like all the previous advances, has been caused primarily due to a complete breakdown in coordination between Ukrainian units, and terrible command decisions which has so far led to at least 20 soldiers being encircled (although this number is likely higher). Superior Russian manpower and firepower has resulted in Ukrainian forces suffering heavy casualties while attempting their chaotic withdrawal. \n+ ~2.11 km² in favour of Russia.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",
