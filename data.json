I've colour coded red as the first step of Russian advances, purple as the 2nd step and pink as the 3rd step. Ukrainian withdrawal is represented by blue and future Russian advances by orange. The first and most critical step for Russian forces is to seize the coal mine north of Udachnoye. This will serve as a critical base for Russian attacks to both Sergeyevka and Grishino. Once Russia secures the coal mine and consolidates, they can move NE to cut the E50 highway and put the O0525 under fire control. This will be in sync with russia taking Rodinskoye, allowing them to launch attacks and pressure the remaining routes into the city from both the SW and NE. Inevitably, the AFU will be forced to withdraw to more defensible positions by leaving Lysovka, Sukhyy Yar and Promon. (1/2)",

In the long term, by developing a significant breach of the final AFU defensive line, Russian forces will be able to sweep behind Kramatorsk and Druzhkovka, finally collapsing the Donbass.
