They repelled the most recent Ukrainian counterattacks north of the Haichur River which were aimed at expanding their bridgehead and began pushing back from the area of the agricultural buildings, eventually eliminating Ukraine's bridgehead altogether. \nFrom there, building on their momentum, Russian forces crossed the Haichur River into the western part of Hulyaipole, establishing a foothold on Travnya 1st street in the area of the school and the intersection with Michurina Street. The bridgehead was subsequently connected with the older bridgehead to the northwest, forming a solid front against Ukrainian defences in the western part of the city. \nThese attacks across the Haichur River were done in coordination with assault operations in the city centre. Russian forces advanced from their bridgehead in the area of the hospital complex and captured the local high school, the police station, and the district museum. Once these main strongpoints were taken, they pushed further northwest to Luhova Street and linked up with the larger bridgehead in the western part of the city. They also further expanded their zone of control in the city centre, capturing additional 3-story apartment buildings and the city's administrative building. Attacks are now underway on the western part of the city centre in the direction of the northeastern edge of the Ukrainian stronghold in the high-rise blocks. \nTo the south, Russian forces managed to eliminate the Ukrainian pocket in the eastern part of Hulyaipole. It's unclear how many soldiers managed to escape the operational encirclement. From there, they captured rest of the southern low-rise residential streets, while other forces managed to consolidate in at least 9 high-rise buildings of the main stronghold. Additionally, the earlier Ukrainian counterattacks west of the high-rise blocks were repelled, however Russian progress has significantly slowed here. \n+ ~4.12 km² in favour of Russia.",

Russian forces managed to consolidate in the remaining treelines and forested areas east of the Haichur and south of the Yanchur Rivers, which they used to accumulate in before crossing the Haichur River, infiltrating and quickly establishing control over the village of Pishchane.\nOther forces advanced west along the northern bank of the Yanchur River from the area of the Hulyaipole - Pokrovs'ke highway and captured the village of Ostapivske and the surrounding treelines. Other forces improved their positions southwest of Vidradne, capturing new treeline positions. From there, they pushed north from Ostapivske to the neighbouring village of Andriivka and consolidated in its southern streets. Assault operations were then carried out further north, allowing for the Russians to bring most of the settlement under their control. Fighting continues for the northern streets, which remain in the grey-zone.\nIn the south, following earlier infiltrations, Russian forces managed to consolidate in the treelines across the Haichur River west of Nove Zaporizhzhya. Other assault groups continued expanding their main bridgehead by advancing further north and linked up with this smaller bridgehead west of Nove Zaporizhzhya. \n+ ~24.33 km² in favour of Russia.",
