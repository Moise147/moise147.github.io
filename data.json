They re-secured the treeline positions southeast of the village and began pushing back into its western houses. \nOnce the village was back under their control, Russian soldiers advanced into the southern part of Rodynske, and began attacking towards the city centre. This was done in coordination with other forces capturing the rest of the high-rise buildings in the southeast of the city. Meanwhile, in the north of the Rodynske, Russian forces continued to clear the low-rise residential areas. As a result, the area under Ukrainian control is rapidly shrinking as they get squeezed out of the rest of the city centre and western suburbs. \n+ ~3.85 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
