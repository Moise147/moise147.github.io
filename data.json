These operations have been conducted in areas where Russian forces did not properly entrench in and only moved through to their forward positions west of the river. \nDue to this lack of Russian consolidation, the Ukrainians were able to regain control over the village of Radisne which had previously been in a sort of zone of Russian influence with no permanent presence, and managed to link up with isolated pockets of soldiers in the treelines further east. As a result, a large grey-zone has formed stretching up to 4.5 km wide in some areas, where both sides have overlapping positions in an extremely fluid and dynamic situation. \nThe establishment of solid positions east of the river by Ukraine has allowed them to increase their overall presence in this grey-zone of mixed positions in recent weeks, significantly complicating Russian logistics to their own bridgeheads west of the Haichur river. Nevertheless, Russian forces continued their operations west of the river, with DRGs still infiltrating the village of Kosivtseve, and for the first time, entering the town of Ternuvate.\n+ ~13.70 km² in favour of Ukraine.",

This was reported by Oksana Hryhorieva, gender advisor to the General Staff of the AFU. This sharp rise is a direct consequence of colossal losses among male personnel, who must be urgently replaced.\nAs Hryhorieva notes, female graduates of military universities from 2019 have already attained the ranks of captain and major. Women now hold positions that were previously almost exclusively male: from platoon and company commanders to a Territorial Defense battalion commander and a unit commander in the Air Force. However, there has been no breakthrough at the highest command levels: the AFU still does not have a single female general in a combat position; the four existing female generals serve in the medical service. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
