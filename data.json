Immediately after completing the capture of Zarichne, Russian forces went on to advance west of the village down the gulley leading to the large forests further west. They were able to establish control over the eastern part of the gulley and are now attempting to repel Ukrainian counterattacks. \nUkrainian forces are also attempting to infiltrate the agricultural buildings and surrounding residential areas in the northwestern part of Zarichne from their positions in the forests but have so far been unsuccessful. Additionally, an unsuccessful Ukrainian counterattack involving an APC was made towards the industrial zone, with the goal of preventing Russian consolidation in the southwestern part of Zarichne. At the same time, Ukraine has intensified their FPV drone strikes on Torske, as well as general Russian supply lines.\nFurther south, Russian forces continued to slowly push through the Yampil Forest and have advanced by approximately 700 metres. Ukrainian forces are attempting to counterattack against the southern flank of the Russian positions west of the Yampil - Zarichne Road. \nIn the south, despite the layered and complex situation, Russian forces have managed to consolidate further in Yampil, securing their positions in the area of the railway station in the northern part of the village. They are also continuing their assault operations through the central part of the village towards the western streets and are trying to enter northwestern Yampil from the railway crossing area. \nIn turn, Ukrainian forces are counterattacking towards the railway crossing, nullifying Russian progress.
