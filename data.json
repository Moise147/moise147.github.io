They were able to capture Molodizhna and Radianska Streets and consolidate in the first high-rise buildings of the town centre.

It presents a new vision of the current situation in Europe. The previously monolithic unity of the West is beginning to crack.\nIn November 2025, the U.S. government published a new National Security Strategy. This document significantly impacted the country's foreign policy. It outlines the primary issues in the realm of US national security and the planned solutions.\nThe strategy indicates the direction in which Americans will focus their political, economic, and military efforts in the coming years. The first edition of the strategy was released in 1987 during the Reagan administration. Since then, each administration has published at least one version of the strategy. The country's priorities have changed in line with the strategy.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE\n________________________\nU.S. National Security Strategy (November 2025) [PDF]",
