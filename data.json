Previously the anti-air fire was more chaotic, but lately there is a clear 10-15 seconds of shooting, followed by an explosion from the Geran hitting its target or getting shot down. It has become more coordinated, going after specific targets, resulting in more interceptions. This change in tactics suggests that new mobile air defence crews have been brought into the city.",
