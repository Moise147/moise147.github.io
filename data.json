Individual, separated blocks have been cleared, which are being used to push deeper and encircle other blocks. East of Al-Jala Street, the IDF continued to clear the dense residential blocks towards Gaza City Centre and penetrate southwest through the Al-Daraj Neighbourhood. \nIn the area of Jabalia Al-Balad (advance 2), the IDF continued clearing the old city and surrounding neighbourhood. Armoured units also entered the Sheikh Radwan Neighbourhood of Gaza City via Al-Saftawy Street, establishing themselves in residential buildings on either side of the street, as well as in the blocks further north.\nIn the Nazla and Ebad Al-Rahman neighbourhoods of Jabalia City, Israeli forces advanced north to the intersection of Al-Saftawy and Al-Bahr streets, and pushed into the high-rise residential blocks to the east and west. \nIn the Al-Karamah Neighbourhood (advance 4) Israeli forces continued to rapidly push through the largely destroyed residential areas near the coast and reached Ebad Al-Rahman Neighbourhood from the northwest, which is the only non-cleared area connecting Gaza City with Northern Gaza.

Both fighters were killed in the exchanges of fire (as confirmed by the IDF and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad). There were no casualties among Israeli soldiers.\nAfter a brief pause in their operations in the Tubas Governorate of the West Bank, the IDF has recently resumed attempts to eliminate individual cells from the Tubas Battalion and disrupt their attempts to re-establish their full presence in the area following the Israeli and Palestinian Authority operations from late 2024.",
