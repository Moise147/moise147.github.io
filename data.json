They then crossed the river to the south, capturing treeline positions on the opposite tactical heights, while other forces began pushing to the southwest. The Russians then secured the rest of the positions north of Zatyshshya, began pushing to the northwest of the village, and captured its northern street. Assault groups from the southern bank of the Kalmychka River then entered the southern street of the village from the east, quickly establishing control over it and a section of the road to the south.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces made additional progress along the tactical heights northeast of Hulyaipole, fleshing out the spearhead towards Varvarivka. They secured the agricultural buildings northwest of Zatyshshya and the treelines to the north, before crossing the Velyka Novosilka - Hulyaipole Road, and entering three parallel treelines to the west. Other assault groups secured the rest of the positions north of the gulley west of Yablukove, and advanced southwest and uphill to the other treelines west of the Velyka Novosilka - Hulyaipole Road. \nTo the north, Russian forces continued taking positions in the direction of the Hulyaipole - Pokrovsk'e Road and captured new positions in three separate treelines north of the initial breakthrough to the reservoirs.

They then levelled the frontline between Yehorivka and Hai, capturing positions in six different treelines.\nMeanwhile, new Ukrainian reinforcements brought in from the Orikhiv direction, along with elements of the 425th Separate Assault Regiment \"Skala\" carried out counterattacks on the village of Danylivka, recently captured by Russia. They advanced east from their positions south of Ostapivske, entering the western part of Danylivka.
