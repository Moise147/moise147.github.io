They are now trying to infiltrate even further south, entrenching south of Novopavlivka and reaching the gulley east of Filiya where they are attempting to clear the strongpoints there. \nAs a result of these attacks, and attempts to cross the Solena River from the west, the remaining Russian formations in Novopavlivka are operationally encircled and have no ground supply lines leading to their positions. \nMeanwhile, to the southwest, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Filiya and established control over the rest of the fortified forest there, pushing the Ukrainians back to the treelines further north.\n+ ~23.60 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.83 km² in favour of Russia.",

They also captured the remaining apartment buildings of the Zapadny District, including the local kindergarten.\nIn the north, Russian forces continued to slowly advance through Rodynske, and after heavy fighting managed to break through the Ukrainian defence in the three-story buildings near Myru Street, aligning the front with Shakhtarskoi Slavy Street.

The previously monolithic unity of the West is beginning to crack.\nIn November 2025, the U.S. government published a new National Security Strategy. This document significantly impacted the country's foreign policy. It outlines the primary issues in the realm of US national security and the planned solutions.\nThe strategy indicates the direction in which Americans will focus their political, economic, and military efforts in the coming years. The first edition of the strategy was released in 1987 during the Reagan administration. Since then, each administration has published at least one version of the strategy.
