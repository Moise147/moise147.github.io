They broke through further Ukrainian positions, clearing them and establishing control over a section of the river's northern bank, encircling Ukrainian formations against the river to the east. \nFrom there, Russian forces began clearing the salient west of Dibrova, where they captured numerous positions and trench complexes, meeting up with assault groups advancing south of Torske. Ukrainian forces were withdrawn over the Siverskyi Donets River to the Dronivka area, with the Russians establishing a solid line of contact in the direction of the Zherebets - Siverskyi-Donets River intersection.\n+ ~30.20km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "In the Kostyantynivka direction, Russian forces continued to advance and have completed the capture of Katerynivka. \nAfter over a week of inactivity, Russian forces advanced from their initial positions in the southwestern part of the village towards the northern and central parts, capturing new positions there, and forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw from their positions in the low-lying ground to the southeast, and from their positions in the southern streets. The Ukrainians maintained control over the northeastern houses of Katerynivka to allow for a full withdrawal to neighbouring Kleban-Byk to take place. \nOnce this withdrawal was completed and the Russians were in full control of Katerynivka, they were able to quickly enter Kleban-Byk. They reached Zelena Street in the village centre, and occupied seven 3-story buildings, the local school, and numerous other positions in the southern residential area. \nMeanwhile, east of Kryvyi Torets River, the Russians completed the capture of the town of Shcherbynivka and captured further positions along the windbreaks next to the railway line. \n+ ~4.84 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
