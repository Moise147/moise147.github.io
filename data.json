      "original": "Regarding the situation with the Russian breakthrough at Dobropillya-Bilozerske:\nAfter over a week of deep infiltrations, the frontline has largely stabilised following the arrival of reinforcements from both sides.\nNewly arrived Ukrainian units, including the  93rd Mechanized Brigade, 12th \"Azov\" Brigade of the NGU, 4th \"Rubizh\" Brigade of the NGU, 1st \"Da Vinci\" assault battalion and the 25th Assault Battalion, have begun digging in and counterattacking.\nRussian DRGs have largely been cleared from the approaches of Dobropillya and Bilozerske, and Ukrainian counterattacks took place in two main directions. After re-securing the section of the Dobropillya - Kramatorsk Highway, the 1st \"Da Vinci\" assault battalion attempted to enter Zolotyi Kolodyaz, but were repelled by the newly reinforced Russian garrison (which may include special forces) after heavy fighting. The 2nd mechanised battalion of the 93rd brigade counterattacked in the direction of the heights south of Kucheriv Yar. The outcome of this is currently unknown.\nThe 12th \"Azov\" brigade of the NGU has begun digging in around Rubizhne and Novyi Donbas. Rubizhne is contested, but mostly under Ukrainian control. Novyi Donbas is under full Ukrainian control after the DRGs were cleared from around Dobropillya. It's unclear what Ukrainian unit is holding Stepy (possibly the Rubizh Brigade?), which lies between Rubizhne and Novyi Donbas. Additionally, the Russians have accumulated manpower in Nove Shakhove, and now have a strong presence there.\nIn the Dorozhnje area, Ukrainian forces - after withdrawing behind the village - managed to hold a defence in the treelines on the tactical heights there.\nIn the Vesele - Hruzke area, Russian forces were able to capture most of Vesele. There is no information from Hruzke, but the main Ukrainian presence is held in the gulleys to the southeast of the village, suggesting it could be in the grey zone.\nIn Shakhove - Volodomyrivka, Ukrainian forces hold a strong defence in Shakhove, while drones (probably from the \"Typhoon\" company of the NGU) are preventing the Russians from capturing the rest of Volodymyrivka. No new information from Pankivka, which remains under Russian control.\nOverall, the situation has significantly improved for Ukraine here, but at the cost of other sectors of the frontline being significantly weakened - notably the Kostyantynivka direction. This breakthrough will undoubtably be used by Russia in the future for further gains, as it has completely destabilised a section of Ukraine's main defensive line.",
