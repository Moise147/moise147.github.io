Israel said that its troops were on a mission to arrest suspects from a “terror group”. Later, Hebrew media reported that the involvement of the Syrian intelligence was suspected.\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\nTrump went on to stress that he was “very satisfied” with Syria’s current performance under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who made a historic visit to the White House in November.\nRead more \nHERE",
