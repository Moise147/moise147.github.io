      "original": "It feels like its been a while since i've addressed the overall situation across the front in Ukraine. Over the last few months, Ukrainian forces have been conducting localised counterattacks in various places across the front when they hold a slight numerical advantage. However, this has significantly depleted the overall situation for the AFU, as the strategic whack-a-mole game grows in intensity. Gaps are opening up more frequently, and in greater magnitude. The biggest example was the Zolotyy Kolodyaz breakthrough, which forced Ukraine to pull elite Azov units from the Serebryanske forestry and Kupyansk, as well as regular units from Pokrovske direction. What we saw was the clearest evidence of the whackamole theory yet, as villages toward Pokrovske tumbled, the Serebraynske forest, which had held out for over 2 YEARS collapsed immediately, and Russian forces now controlling over half of Kupyansk. The whack a mole game continues, and will continue, with larger and larger gaps opening up, until the eventual end of organised resistance by the AFU. To be vulnerable and honest, i've made so many mistakes predicting a timeline of collapse, so im not gonna try to predict a timeline again lol. But collapse is happening, in stages, gradually.",

They were able to capture positions along Lermontova Street, which leads to Sobolivka, while assault groups penetrated further south to the high-rise buildings of the Yuvileynyi Neighbourhood in the southwest of the city. \nEast of the Kupyanka River, Russian forces improved their positions in the residential areas and reached the industrial zone in the centre of Kupyansk.

Deep advances were made along the gulley on the Dnipropetrovsk - Zaporizhzhia Regional Border, with Russian forces approaching the rear of Novohryhorivka. \nIn Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, after taking Novomykolaivka, Russian forces stormed the eastern outskirts of Kalynivske, while aviation and artillery worked on the main Ukrainian defensive nodes in the area. This collapsed the Ukrainian defense of the flanks and allowed for the Russians to quickly take the lightly defended village of Kalynivske, as well as the adjacent fortifications. The fall of Kalynivske allowed for Russian forces to push along the treelines on the tactical heights to the south, and level the front south of Kalynivske. They were also able to capture positions northwest and north of Kalynivka in the forests and treelines in the low-lying ground, approaching Stepove from the south. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to develop their offensive in the area of Sosnivka. They were able to capture another treeline north of Berestove, and secured a series of treeline intersections northwest of Ternove, forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the salient south of Sosnivka. \n+ ~39.80 km² in favour of Russia.",

The Tu-160 was equipped with missiles at Ukrainka, while the Tu-95MS has since been equipped at Engels-2 and is currently in the air, flying to Olenya Airbase. Thus, 6 Tu-95MS bombers and 1 Tu-160 bomber are known to be equipped with cruise missiles. \nInterestingly, the Black Sea Fleet has seemingly completed loading of Kalibr cruise missiles before the completion of Tu-95MS/160 preparations, despite possible delays from Ukraine's UAV attacks on Novorossiysk Naval Base in Krasnodar Krai. \nAdditionally, Geran-2/3 and Gerbera drone accumulation has been continuing as normal, with daily Geran-2/3drone launches not exceeding 100 since the last attack. \nThe most likely time for a missile attack is the night of 28 September to the morning of the 29 September, but it could even take place as early as tonight.",
