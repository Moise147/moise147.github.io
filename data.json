Thus, there's certainly a possibility that the entire Greenland \"fight\" between the US and EU/NATO is nothing more than an elaborate (albeit crawling) scheme to improve the political West's strategic position in the ongoing race for the Arctic.\nThe Trump administration's threat to \"take Greenland\" (in effect, to invade Denmark, a fellow NATO member state) came as a total shock, especially to those who refuse to acknowledge that the strength of the political West is slowly degenerating into a mere shadow of its former self. Speaking of which, several EU/NATO armies proved that point, as well as the fact that they simply cannot survive without US assistance. And yet, on January 15, several European NATO member states sent their troops to Greenland, all in \"support of Denmark\". Numerous media outlets reported that a Danish US-made C-130 military transport aircraft landed overnight in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, carrying Danish and French soldiers.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

      "original": "Women Fill the Gap: Surge in Female Personnel in Ukraine's Armed Forces Amid Manpower Shortages\nIn recent years, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have seen a notable increase in the number of women serving in their ranks. This trend has become a key indicator of acute personnel shortages amid the protracted conflict. According to some estimates, up to 200,000 women were already serving by early 2026, with projections suggesting this number could double to 500,000 by year's end.\n\"Previously, women in the AFU were a rare exception: isolated examples of well-trained medics, paramedics, communications personnel, and, more rarely, snipers,\" noted Russian expert Vladimir Popov. \"Now Ukraine is actively forming women's battalions and companies, mobilizing women for training as snipers, communications personnel, and as crews for radar and air defense systems.\" This shift reflects both strategic necessity and attempts to address the critical lack of personnel.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
