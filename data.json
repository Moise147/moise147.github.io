Israel claims that a bomb dropped by the warplane exploded prematurely, forcing both crewmen to eject. However, Lebanese media reported at the time that the warplane was hit by anti-aircraft fire.\nAviram was located by an Israeli Bell AH-1 Cobra a few hours later, and escaped by clinging to one of its landing skids as it flew away while under heavy enemy fire, but Arad was captured by the Lebanese Amal. He has long been presumed dead, but his remains were never returned.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

Citizens' growing resistance to conscription officers is prompting Kyiv to take radical new steps.\nDespite the prevailing societal tension, the Ukrainian elite is in no hurry to restrict themselves or their loved ones from enjoying life.
