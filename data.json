А поряд із ним — наш новий проєкт. \nF-16 — найскладніша західна техніка, на яку ми так довго чекали. «Повернись живим» за запитом Міністерства оборони України та з підтримкою державної компанії Укрнафта розробили, придбали та передали для Повітряних Сил Збройних Сил України перші в країні мобільні комплекси для обслуговування літаків нового зразка.\nІ все це — «Проєкт 61»\nВ умовах реальної війни, коли ворог полює на літаки й аеродроми, Повітряним Силам бракувало мобільності в питаннях обслуговування як самих F-16, так і їхнього авіаційного озброєння.\nПеред вами унікальна, самостійна та ефективна екосистема, яка спирається на реальні потреби України у цій війні:\n— мобільний комплекс планування місій, де проводиться передпольотний брифінг льотчиків та супровід бортів у ближній зоні;\n— два комплекси підготовки авіаційного озброєння, які прискорюють підготовку та перевірку боєприпасів, а також полегшують їх підвіску до літака.\n«Раніше для підвіски одного боєприпасу було необхідно від 10 до 12 осіб. Завдяки цьому комплексу, тепер це можливо реалізувати за допомогою трьох людей», — розповідає Сергій, представник «Офісу 61», який займається розвитком державної авіації.\nВтілити в життя це просте, але таке необхідне рішення допомогла Укрнафта, яка зробила внесок у 49 438 176,90 грн. Ця екосистема враховує передовий досвід Європи, спирається на реальні потреби України та допомагає літакам нового зразка реалізувати весь свій потенціал.",

      "original": "I think one thing that a lot of people underestimate is how many civilians remain in the Pokrovsk area. Pokrovsk alone has thousands of residents still holding out, while Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's residents combined also number in the thousands. I'd estimate over 5,000 in total remain across the 4 settlements. \nThe last shops and convenience stores closed in Rodynske last week, giving away all of their stock to civilians, but only after the Russians broke through towards the city's eastern outskirts. As of roughly two months ago, a few local shops in Pokrovsk City Centre were still selling basic supplies including food, water, antibiotics, and other medicines, although it's possible that these have since finally closed considering the deteriorating situation on the flanks and intensified Russian bombardment. \nOn average, 1 civilian in Pokrovsk is killed daily from the Russian artillery, MLRS, drone and FAB bombardment. This is despite its population still numbering in the thousands, its proximity to the frontline, the heavy Ukrainian presence in the city, and its strategic importance to the Russians.\nPokrovsk - as far as I know - was more Anti-Russia than most cities in the Donbas, especially Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut and Donetsk City. Nevertheless, people choose to stay behind, usually because they are waiting for \"liberation\" or because they have grown up there and lived in the city for their whole lives. It's all they have ever known, so it makes it more difficult to leave to cities further west. \nAdditionally, many residents who were evacuated from cities such as Avdiivka moved to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, yet less than a year later these cities were practically on the frontlines and under heavy Russian bombardment. Many people, especially elderly, do not want to have to go through the struggle or uprooting their lives and relocating once, let alone twice within a year. \nToday, a large portion of Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's populations are elderly, although many are middle-aged or younger. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 either escaped or were mobilised. Localised mobilisation efforts were still ongoing in Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad up until 1-2 weeks ago, which had previously been ramped up when extra police and TCC units from other regions were sent to bolster Donetsk's police and TCC force, although I expect these efforts have since halted considering recent events.",

You have to remember, this war has been ongoing for over 3 years, and Russian air tactics remain largely the same.

FABs also targeted almost every part of the village held by the AFU, causing significant casualties among their forces and slowing their advance. \nRussian FAB glide-bombs then struck the bridge between the two reservoirs, connecting the centre to the eastern part of the village, to complicate further Ukrainian movement west. The remaining Russian soldiers were then withdrawn from the village centre. \nDespite this extensive bombardment, Ukrainian soldiers managed to cross the tributary and establish positions in a few houses in the northwest of the village. The Russians tried to cut off the Ukrainians in the northwest by attacking to the northern street from the area of the reservoirs but were forced to retreat back after encountering heavy resistance, indicating further Ukrainian reinforcements have been getting brought in. \nAt the same time, Ukrainian forces had to withdraw from the gulley west of Kindrativka back to the treeline to the south, after being hit by over a dozen FABs and failing to consolidate. It's likely that this was a diversionary attack for the main operation on Kindrativka from the west, tying up Russian forces and complicating their movement in and out of the village.\n+ ~4.95km² in favour of Ukraine.",
