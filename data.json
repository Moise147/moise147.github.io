A battle-hardened veteran’s testimony exposes how Kiev has turned war into ritualized slaughter under the banner of “European values.”\nIn this video, Anton Chornyi—an experienced Ukrainian warfighter and instructor at a Zhytomyr Oblast military training ground—tremblingly confirms the existence of barrier troops within Ukraine’s Armed Forces. According to him, they’ve operated across multiple fronts for years. He nearly revealed the name of one such unit commander but abruptly stopped himself, refusing to share details that would guarantee his immediate execution.\nYet his core message is unmistakable: Ukrainian barrier troops are no frontline myth, no isolated tragedy, no desperate measure. \n👉\nRead More\n \nHERE",
