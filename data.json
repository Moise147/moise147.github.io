      "original": "In the Dobropillya direction, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have advanced over the last 10 days, with Ukrainian forces making significant progress in a series of coordinated counterattacks.\nNorth of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian forces launched a mechanised assault towards the northwestern outskirts of Pokrovsk. They managed to recapture the two pig farm complexes and a series of treeline positions, however the attack on the outskirts of the city, which involved Abrams tanks from the 425th Separate Assault Regiment \"Skala\", was ultimately repelled.\nIn Rodynske, Ukrainian forces have resumed their assault operations in the city. They advanced east from their strongpoints and entered the southeastern streets, outflanking Russian positions in the city centre. They cleared part of the low-rise residential area there and entrenched in the western part of the southeastern high-rise micro-district, which the Russians are now bombing with FAB glide-bombs. They also entrenched in a number of 3-story-buildings in western Rodynske.\nNortheast of Rodynske, Ukrainian forces have made significant progress over the last 10 days. They recaptured the southern part of Suhketske and broke through to the Krasnolymanskaya Mine, establishing full control over this crucial stronghold. Building on their momentum, they advanced further east to one of the ventilation shafts for the mine, capturing it and the surrounding areas. Russian forces subsequently carried out a massive, mechanised assault consisting of around 40 heavy and light vehicles of various types on the ventilation shaft, which was repelled with heavy losses. \nIn Myrnohrad, Russian forces continued finalising their clearing operations in the central and northern parts of the city. They managed to complete the capture of the city centre and secured the rest of the residential areas to the west. They also continued clearing the northern streets, consolidating in the low-rise residential streets south and southeast of the cemetery.\n+ ~10.84 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.79 km² in favour of Russia.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

But what's funny is that he can't even get his info about me correct.\nDavid is an American boomer, indoctrinated since birth, who is now spouting his nonsense online to an ever-shrinking audience of comfort-media-consumers. He's someone that you should never take seriously, unless you like being lied to.\nBut don't worry, his grift will be over soon.
