This city has been on the frontlines for nearly three years, and Russia is on the brink of capturing it. \nRussian forces have rapidly reached the city centre from the north, and are now just 1.5km from the main bridge over the Oskil River connecting the Ukrainian bridgehead on its eastern bank - including in eastern Kupyansk - to the rest of Kharkiv Oblast.\nOnce this highway is cut, all supplies into the pocket will have to go via a bridge to the south in Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi, or over pontoon bridges (although this brings its own separate issues). This creates a bottle neck that can easily be targeted, which will naturally result in the collapse of the bridgehead, the alignment of the front along the river, and a refocusing of efforts to complete the capture of the city and the surrounding areas. \nSupply is already difficult for the AFU in the bridgehead, and the only thing preventing the current Russian assault operations there from achieving breakthroughs is the natural obstacles and significant fortification that lie in Russia's way. \nWhile the fall of Kupyansk may not be imminent, there is a real threat of this northern bridge being cut, which will undoubtably create massive problems for Ukrainian forces in the area.",
