Work to set up the underground route reportedly took four days. Resting and resupply points were established along the pipeline.\nRead more \nHERE",

The team is known for exposing corruption schemes within the highest echelons of power.\nIn this investigation, Bihus.Info focuses on a key contradiction: while officials and public figures urge young people to remain in Ukraine, prepare for war, and \"row in the same boat,\" their own children study at prestigious foreign universities. This exposes a system of double standards where patriotic rhetoric is directed at the general public, while the offspring of the powerful elites are ensured safety and quality education abroad.\nRead more \nHERE",
