War doesn't work like a Hollywood movie where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. The stronger side wins and the weaker side loses - at least in a war of attrition. \nThe fact that people think THIS plan is unacceptable to Ukraine is insane to me and shows how delusional many have gotten. With how things are going, in the next year and a half Ukraine likely will have been defeated. \nEven for people who see this war as a linear \"Russia took X number of kilometres in Y amount of time, therefore it will take 200 years for them to get to Kyiv\" are being proven wrong by reality now. Using that logic, at this current rate of advance, Russia will reach the Dnipro River at Zaporizhzhia City (a city of over 700k people) in less than a year. The linear claim used to be 90 years, or 1,000 years. \n\"Oh, but Russia could just leave, why should Ukraine cede territory!\" Trump could also resign today, Elon Musk could donate $50 Billion to charity. The amount of brain rotting shit that people try to portray as actual arguments is mind numbing.\nThis isn't how war works. Why would Russia leave? They are winning and know they will win if they keep pushing. People are seriously conflating reality with their perception of an ideal situation, and the fact that this opinion is so widely accepted and promoted is proof of what emotional attachments to entities (Ukraine), and propaganda can do.",
