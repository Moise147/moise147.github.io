A minimum of 2 Kh-59s, 2 Kalibrs and 2 Kh-101s were shot down. \nThe main targets for this strike were once again Ukrainian energy infrastructure. The following was hit:\nDnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant, Zaporizhzhia Oblast (47.86934, 35.08132) by ~8 Iskander-M ballistic missiles.\nUnknown target in northern Zaporizhzhia City, Zaporizhzhia Oblast by ~5 Iskander-M ballistic missiles.\nUnknown target in Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast by 2 Iskander-Ms. \nLadyzhyn Thermal Power Plant, Vinnytsia Oblast (48.70478, 29.22006) by ~2 Kinzhals, ~10 Kh-101s, and 2 Kalibrs. \nDobrotvirska Thermal Power Plant, Lviv Oblast (50.21388, 24.37588) by ~2 Kinzhals and ~5 Kh-101s.\nBurshtyn Thermal Power Plant, Ivano-Frankivak Oblast (49.20971, 24.66424) by ~3 Kh-101s and 2 Kalibrs.\nKalush Coal Power Plant, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (49.07006, 24.31860) by ~2 Kh-101s. \nDashava Underground Gas Storage Facility, Lviv Oblast (49.40383, 23.89924) by ~2 Kalibrs.\nStarokostyantyniv Airbase, Khmelnytskyi Oblast.
