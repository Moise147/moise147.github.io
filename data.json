I estimate that there is a BARE MINIMUM of 500 soldiers effectively cut off in and around Myrnohrad, however some successful withdrawals have taken place. \nIn Pokrovsk City, Russian forces continued their advance towards the northern outskirts and now control the majority of the city. They have captured the rest of the northwestern industrial zone and broke out of the city limits to the nearby treelines. Here, they were able to infiltrate all the way to the outskirts of the stronghold village Hryshyne where Ukraine's main defences are located. Reinforcements from elements of the 32nd Mechanised Brigade were successfully withdrawn from northern Pokrovsk and are now deployed in Hryshyne alongside the 68th \"Jaeger\" Brigade.\nHowever, the main Russian push on this axis has been towards the Ukrainian strongpoints southeast of Hryshyne. These strongpoints were bombed with several FAB glide-bombs, including a FAB-3000, completely destroying them. Russian soldiers are now attempting to cross the dam next to the reservoir and enter the treelines where these strongpoints are located, while simultaneously infiltrating further into the northernmost neighbourhoods of Pokrovsk.\nIn the city centre, Russian forces were able to clear the remaining pockets of Ukrainian resistance in the Pervomaika District and city centre, capturing Pokrovsk's Administrative building and railway station. With these new areas secured, FPV drone pilots have been deployed to the central suburbs of Pokrovsk, while forward deployment and accumulation points were set up in the southern suburbs, allowing for a significant increase in the supply of heavy weaponry and vehicles into the city. \nIn the eastern suburbs, after dislodging Ukraine from their main defensive stronghold, the Russians achieved a breakthrough to the northern outskirts of Pokrovsk. Small, mobile Ukrainian assault groups are attempting to clear them out but are having no success due to Russian numerical superiority and the fluidity of the frontline. Russian forces have since advanced east, bypassing the high-rise district from the north and capturing the church area. They also entered the main factory in the eastern suburbs of the city, where they are attempting to push towards the park.\nIn the southeastern suburbs of Pokrovsk, Russian forces fully consolidated west of the highway and entered the villages of Hnativka and Rih. Neither village has been brought under full control, but Russian presence here is significant. \nIn southern Myrnohrad, Ukrainian forces withdrew from their main defensive positions in the 3-story-buildings after being bombed by numerous FABs, with very few soldiers remaining in the southern suburbs of the city. Some forces are now stationed in the northern suburbs of the city, while others attempted to escape the pocket through the small corridor of fields while being targeted by Russian artillery and FPV drones. As a result, the Russians were able to capture practically all of southeastern Myrnohrad, along with the terykon, and reached the central high-rise district. \nIn the northeastern suburbs of Myrnohrad, Russian forces managed to dismount and enter the main high-rise district here. They quickly gained a foothold and linked up with other forces advancing from the treeline further north. At least 10 high-rise buildings are under their control now. Artillery and FAB strikes are targeting the main Ukrainian defensive positions in the western part of this high-rise district, ahead of the Russian advance. Additionally, they were able to enter the city at a new point, advancing from the Kapitalna Industrial Zone to the low-rise residential areas, where at least 12 blocks were brought under their control. \n(Continued below)",

They are finally beginning the withdrawal from these two major cities, but many troops are still stuck, and many more will be killed attempting to escape the pocket. The fact that positions still exist in Lysivka and Sukhyi Yar - over 14 km deep into the pocket - show the current priorities of the Ukrainian command when it comes to their PR cities such as these ones. \nPokrovsk and Myrnohrad ARE strategically important, and anyone telling you otherwise either doesn't know what they are talking about or is outright lying. The Ukrainian command has once again betrayed their troops, and those online lying about the true situation unfolding have done so too. \nOnly time will tell what will happen after the fall of these cities, but it is known that Russia will soon gain a major logistical hub in the Donbas which will undoubtably help significantly in their future operations in this direction. Remember - all the fronts feed into each other, and developments elsewhere (especially in adjacent sectors) could be crucial to how this direction develops in the future.\n(Link to part 1)",
