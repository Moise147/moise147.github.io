For him, family comes first—not flags or ideologies.\n\"The problem is we don't want to be mobilized. If I were a contract soldier or some great patriot, that would be different. I'm a patriot of my family, not of anyone else. Yes, I'm a citizen of Ukraine, but it gave me nothing. What flag... I slaved away 12 hours a day at the furnace.\"",
