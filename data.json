      "original": "Russia Ramps Up Drone Production Amid NATO No-Fly Zone Plans And Starlink Disruptions\nThe strikes on September 14‚Äì15 were relatively low: Russian air defenses shot down six Ukrainian drones overnight and four in daylight, mostly in Belgorod. Russia launched 84 Geran/Herbera drones and three missiles, with 59 drones downed. A significant factor was the disruption of Starlink system operations along the entire front line, which Ukrainian military personnel complained about.\nMeanwhile, international observers note a significant increase in the production of Russian attack drones: according to The New York Times, Russia is currently capable of producing approximately 30,000 attack drones per year, and the total number of Russian drones launched against Ukraine in 2025 has reached 34,000.

Russia employs drones in group waves, plotting complex routes...\nRead more \nHERE",

Soon after, nine Israeli posts were established there, including two on the peak of the strategic mountain, which oversaw most of the country‚Äôs southern region up to Damascus, in addition to much of southern Lebanon, the heartland of Hezbollah.\nIsraeli officials who spoke to Channel 12 described the posts on the mountain‚Äôs peak as ‚Äúan indispensable strategic asset.‚Äù\nDamascus rejected the Israeli demand, calling Israel‚Äôs military presence on Syrian territories an ‚Äúoccupation that must end.‚Äù\nRead more \nHERE",

This militarization extends for reasons beyond the fight against drug trafficking and increasing crime, and serves as a warning against mass illegal migration. Although crime in Brussels, the unofficial capital of the European Union and headquarters of NATO, saw a decline by 2011, it rose rapidly again in 2020 and 2023, coinciding with the mass arrival of illegal immigrants to Europe in 2015, leaving the country‚Äôs authorities no choice but to finally announce a crackdown.\nBelgian Minister of Security and Home Affairs Bernard Quintin announced a new security plan last week that includes the deployment of soldiers alongside police in the country‚Äôs major cities, with special attention to areas considered sensitive, such as metro stations and troubled neighborhoods.\nRead more \nHERE",
