The 2 Tu-160s and 3 of the 6 Tu-95s are at Engels-2 Airbase (Saratov Oblast), while the other 3 Tu-95s are at Olenya Airbase (Murmansk Oblast). \nAdditionally, 4-6 Tu-22M3 strategic bombers are equipped with Kh-22 cruise missiles, and ready for use. They are all stationed at Olenya Airbase, and one of these is the one which launched a missile strike on Mykolaiv City a few days ago. Extremely high levels of Tu-22M3 movement have been recorded over the past 4 days. \n5 MiG-31Ks are also equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles, 3 of which are stationed at Savasleika Airbase (Nizhny Novgorod Oblast) and 2 of which are at Akhtubinsk Airbase (Astrakhan Oblast). Not all of these are likely to be used in tomorrow's attack, but the 3 at Savasleika are likely contenders.\nFurthermore, 3 surface carriers and 1 submarine of the \"Varshavyanka\" project are apparently equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, although this information is not confirmed. \nAs for drones, more than 250 Geran-2 drones have been accumulated for launches from several launch locations from multiple directions. Not many were launched today, so tomorrow's numbers are expected to be much larger.",
