From there, they began pushing further northwest to the next forest over, while assault groups on the flanks improved their positions in the treelines.\nTo the west, Russian forces continued attacking northwest from the area of Orikhovo-Vasylivka, capturing numerous treeline positions and entrenching in the first houses on southern Minkivka. With support from assault groups clearing the treelines to the south, Russian forces continued pushing west and northwest from their foothold, clearing additional positions and entering the central and southwestern parts of the village. \nAdditionally, the Russians established control over the treelines southeast and east of Minkivka and began a push up the E-40 Highway in the direction of Pryvillya, which Russian DRGs have already entered. They also managed to clear the rest of the fortified forest along the highway and consolidated in the remaining positions to the southeast. \nIn the southwest, Russian forces infiltrated the village of Novomarkove from their positions northwest of the village along the southern bank of the Siverskyi-Donets Canal. Other forces then entered its southern houses, allowing for it to be brought under full Russian control.
