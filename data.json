They were able to quickly capture the remaining positions north of the Siversk - Lyman highway and began advancing south down the treelines to the rear of the chalk quarry. \nOther forces advanced directly west from Siversk, capturing the trenches just outside the city and quickly entering the chalk quarry from the east.

Since then, the Russians have continued to push west along the tactical heights and occupied new positions in the forest plantations and treelines further west, almost levelling the frontline between Platonivka and Sviato-Pokrovske. Additionally, they were able to complete the capture of Sviato-Pokrovske - establishing control over its western outskirts - and are now engaged in battles for the eastern outskirts of Riznykivka.\nTo the northwest, Russian forces advanced from the strongpoints along the highway and entered the first houses of Ozerne, capturing its northern street. Further west, other forces broke through to the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and entrenched in the northwestern-most houses of Ozerne. \nIn the northwest, Russian forces continued to expand their zone of control in Dibrova and managed to fully capture the eastern half of the village.

They will then fly from Belaya Airbase to their launch lines in western Russia in order to carry out their combat sorties. \nThe 2 (not 3) Tu-95MS strategic bombers which redeployed from Ukrainka Airbase to Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast, yesterday have subsequently flown to Olenya Airbase where they will take off from during the next attack. 1 other Tu-95MS already stationed at Olenya was also equipped with missiles (delivered by an IL-76MD cargo plane) today. \n1 Tu-95MS stationed at Engels-2 Airbase is also equipped with missiles. \nThus, there are at least 4 Tu-95MS and 3 Tu-160M strategic bombers equipped and ready for usage. If Russia were to use this number of bombers, the number of Kh-101 cruise missiles launched would likely be somewhere around 30-40, although this is a very rough estimate.\nThere are no changes to the MiG-31K fighters stationed at Savasleika Airbase, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. 4-6 Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles are expected to be used.\nIskander-M ballistic missiles and possibly Iskander-K cruise missiles will be used as well. Additional deliveries of Iskander-Ms to OTRK installations near Taganrog, Rostov Oblast has been recorded. \nAt least 500 Geran-2 drones are expected to be used too, which have been accumulated at all major launch sites surrounding Ukraine. \nThe main targets for the strike will likely be energy infrastructure in the western regions of Ukraine (highest threat to Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts) and in Kyiv Oblast.",
