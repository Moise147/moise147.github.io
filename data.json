From there, they advanced downhill and east to the outskirts of Hrekivka, recapturing the positions in the low-lying ground there. The Russians were also able to recapture the western edge of the forest towards the swamp on the Kharkiv-Luhansk-Donetsk tri-border point.\nIn the west, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions west of the Nitrius River, significantly expanding their small bridgehead on its western bank. They pushed north through the rest of Hlushchenkove, completing the capture of the village, and began propelling northwards towards Andriivka, threatening to cut off Azov in the salient to the east. Russian forces also advanced west to the tactical heights, seizing new treeline positions and pushing towards the village of Maliivka.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations in Novomykhailivka and Ridkodub, without making any confirmed progress. \n+ ~14.27km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

As a result of recent actions, this goal has been achieved, and the remaining road east of the river resupplying Shandryholove has been physically cut. \nRussian forces advanced from their newly captured positions on the tactical heights northeast of Derylove, as well as from the eastern outskirts of Shandryholove, to the forest plantations southeast of the village. They continued to bypass it, moving further west to the next set of forest plantations, before reaching and cutting the road, and entrenching on the eastern bank of the Nitrius River. \nAs a result, Shandryholove has now been taken into an operational encirclement, as there are no bridges connecting the Ukrainian salient to the western bank of the river. We will likely see attempts be carried out by Ukrainian forces to unblock the road in the near future. \n+ ~4.56 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "In the Lyman direction, Russian forces continued to advance west of the Zherebets River and have made important progress over the past week.\nRussian forces advanced in three areas. In the north, they continued their assault operations to recapture the village of Myrne, advancing south and downhill to the next set of forest plantations. Other forces moved further west, capturing a small farm and gaining a foothold on the southern end of a forested area. Fighting is currently ongoing for the forests west of Myrne, where Ukrainian forces are surrounded on three sides.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces continued their assault on Zarichne, and managed to recapture the Torske Fish Farm after Ukrainian forces withdraw over the Zherebets River. Russian forces then crossed the river at this section, gaining a foothold in the northern part of Zarichne and linking up with their bridgehead in the centre of the village. Fighting is now ongoing for Ozerna Street, which is partially in the grey zone.\nIn the south, after repeated DRG activities, Russian forces were able to cross the Zherebets River at a third point and entered the southern part of Zarichne. They established a foothold at the eastern end of Spartaka and Bulvarna Streets. At the same time, other forces from the central bridgehead advanced south down Poshtova Street, approaching a tributary of the Zherebets River where other Russian formations are entrenched. \n+ ~9.06km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
