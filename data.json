They then entered Sichneve from the north, and established control over the northern part of the village, as well as the nearby treelines on the tactical heights.

They entered the main part of the village shortly afterwards, although there is no evidence of consolidation at this moment. Positions were also recaptured in the adjacent treelines. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces infiltrated through the grey zone of mixed positions for around 4.5 km to the eastern edge of Oleksiivka, which they were able to infiltrate.
