This building was chosen as it is the only structure in the area that hasn't been flattened. I have circled it on the map (coordinates: 31.4887380, 34.4456188). \nMeanwhile, Palestinian armed groups such as the Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) and the Saraya Al-Quds Briagdes (PIJ) continued to carry out ambushes against Israeli forces, primarily utilising IEDs and anti-tank missiles, albeit at a lower rate than previously. \n+ ~0.43km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",

Demolition operations continued in the already occupied parts of the city to support the newly constructed Magen Oz corridor which runs through the centre of Khan Younis to Israeli-occupied Rafah. Despite these recent advances, a significant amount of Khan Younis city centre is yet to be cleared\nMilitants from various Palestinian armed groups continued their attacks on Israeli forces, primarily employing IEDs and mortars. \n+ ~0.18km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",
