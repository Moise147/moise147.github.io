      "original": "Update from the Gaza Strip - Northern Governorate:\nFollowing the announcement by the IDF that they would be beginning their offensive on Gaza City, a series of supporting attacks were launched on the Northern Governorate to support formations advancing in Gaza Governorate. \nIsraeli armoured units began advancing along the coastal Al-Rashid Road, as well as along roads previously created by the IDF during their previous operations here, reaching the first districts of Jabalia City. They were able to quickly clear and capture the outlying streets (31.5529, 34.4642), reaching the edge of the Madinat Al 'Awada Neighbourhood from the north (31.54792, 34.46454). At the same time, other forces captured other key points along the way, including the destroyed Gaza Oil Company complex (31.55287, 34.46791), and the former IDF base at the Gaza Desalination Plant (31.56156, 34.46763). \nTo the southeast, Israeli forces massively intensified their operations in the Nazla Neighbourhood of Jabalia City and cleared a large section of the dense residential zones north of Al-Quds Street, reaching the edge of the Sheik Radwan Neighbourhood of Gaza City (31.53159, 34.47553). \nThe goal here appears to be to isolate remaining Palestinian militant cells in Jabalia Refugee Camp, Jabalia City, Beit Lahiya, and Atatra, so the IDF can focus on establishing a stronger presence in the northern suburbs of Gaza City. \n+ ~2.28 km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",

A large grey zone has formed in the treelines west of the settlement, so it's possible that Ukraine will make attempts at rescuing these soldiers through this. \nHowever, as a result of the local collapse of Ukrainian lines in this area and the subsequent encirclement of Ukrainian troops, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi dismissed Maksym Kituhin, the commander of the 20th Army Corps, from his current position. He will still serve in the AFU, but in another unspecified role.",
