They also made additional incremental advances northwest of the village of Lyman, while other forces were able to enter the residential part of Synelnykove.\nTo the east, Russian forces continued pushing through southern Vovchansk and have advanced from the three-story buildings to the small industrial zone on the southern edge of the city, capturing most of it. They also continued pushing east through the low-rise residential areas, where they reached the highway and destroyed bridge over the Vovcha River, and advanced beyond the highway into the denser residential areas of southern Vovchansk.\nAs a result of these Russian advances, the remaining Ukrainian units stationed in northern Vovchansk withdrew behind the river to prevent being cut off from the rear, officially ending the 18-month-long battles for this part of the city. The withdrawals took place from two small salients of flattened houses in the southeast and east. \nFurther east, over the past ten days Russian forces have been slowly pushing through the forests east of Tykhe, expanding a buffer zone around the newly recaptured village. They advanced further through the large forest in the north and captured treeline positions to the south. They also established control over some outlying houses of Vovchanski Khutory on the northern bank of the Vovcha River, as well as a nearby forest.\n+ ~5.97 km² in favour of Russia.",
