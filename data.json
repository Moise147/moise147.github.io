In the southwest, they continued their operations to clear the village of Shcherbynivka. After they captured the southern and main part of the village, they entered the northern part and began clearing the area of the railway line. Russian forces captured most of the rest of the village, including the local school. They were also able to clear the rest of the positions in the pocket west of Shcherbynivka due to the progress inside the settlement. \nFurther east, Russian forces cleared the remaining positions in western Toretsk after the last Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from the city and captured the rest of the adjacent Toretsk Forest. \nIn the northeast, Russian forces resumed their assault operations northwest of Dyliivka, and established control over positions on four different treelines on the tactical heights.\nAdditionally, in the west, Russian soldiers managed to enter the western part of Katerynivka, although it is unclear if any positions were established. \n+ ~8.27km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "Regarding the situation in the Kostyantynivka direction:\nRussian forces were able to break through from the heavily fortified terykon at the St. Matrona Mine, cut the railway line to Shcherbynivka, and come within 800 metres of cutting off all Ukrainian soldiers in the area to the south of the Kleban-Bykske reservoir. \nAll Ukrainian reinforcements to the villages of Shcherbynivka, Katerynivka and Kleban Byk are running down one road along the dam on the eastern edge of the reservoir, which the Russians are constantly targeting. This road is covered by a large trench strongpoint, which is also being constantly targeted by FPV drones and artillery. \nRussian forces are also pressuring the edges of the salient, where they have infiltrated Katerynivka, almost captured Shcherbynivka, and pushed the Ukrainians away from the northern outskirts of Toretsk. \nIf this road is cut, large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers will be encircled against the reservoir.",
