They completed the capture of the southeastern streets, establishing control over the adjacent trench strongpoint, while improving their positions in the south of the village. \nA mechanised attack was then carried out with the goal of securing the road from Serebryanka, but this was repelled with significant losses. \nSouth of the Plotka River, Russian forces were able to recapture positions in and around the orchards between the reservoirs and began a general push westward along the treelines. Once a solidified presence was established north of the large reservoir, Russian soldiers stormed the trench networks at the terykon overlooking Siversk. They crossed the ponds and cleared the trenches, establishing a presence on the eastern slope of the terykon.\nTo the south, Russian forces moved back into western Verkhnokamyanske - which was in the grey zone - and cleared the largely empty positions in the basements of the ruins. \n+ ~18.84km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
