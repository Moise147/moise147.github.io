      "original": "General overview and analysis of the Pokrovsk direction:\nI have numbered the different sub-sectors on the map to correspond with this post. The green lines represent the usable supply routes into Pokrovsk. \n1. Russian forces continue consolidating in the agricultural buildings on the northern outskirts of Udachne after it moved out of the grey zone. They are also attempting to consolidate and expand their zone of control in the eastern buildings of the Pokrovsk Coal Mine, however Ukrainian FPV drone strikes are impeding any progress. \n2. Russian forces continue to slowly advance in Kotlyne, and have managed to complete the capture of the village after securing the rest of the houses in the grey zone, as well as the small farm to the north. The overall goal in this sector is to capture the Pokrovsk Mine, secure the surroundings of Kotlyne, and begin attacks towards the Serhiivka area in order to bring the E-50 highway to Pokrovsk under fire control.\n3. Russian forces continue infiltration attempts in the Durniak and Pervomaika Districts in western Pokrovsk, with the grey zone now extending for more than 800 metres. Both sides are actively using FPV drones against each other to prevent infantry from accumulating. \n4. Russian soldiers continue to enter the Lazurnyi District of southern Pokrovsk and accumulate in the basements of high-rise buildings. From there, they move further north into the neighbouring Pivdennyi, Shakhtarskyi, and Soniachnyi Districts, but have been unsuccessful in gaining a foothold. Small Ukrainian assault groups constantly move in and clear out Russian soldiers from the basements of high-rise buildings, while the Russians do the same to the Ukrainians, resulting in a large grey zone forming with no coherent line of contact. However, the Russians were able to secure the northern part of the Lazurnyi District, where consolidation is now ongoing. \n5. After capturing Chunyshyne, Russian forces continued advancing north through the windbreaks on either side of the railway tracks, but are being caught in a kill-zone controlled by the air from Ukrainian FPV drones. Nevertheless, some Russian soldiers have managed to reach the western edge of Novopavlivka, although no consolidation has occurred yet. \n6. Russian forces continue attempts at infiltrating the village of Balahan from the forests to the east after the first attacks were repelled. So far, no advances have been confirmed, as some of the more effective Ukrainian units are stationed in Myrnohrad and the surrounding areas, compared to in much of Pokrovsk where there is no cohesive defence on the ground. However, Russia is accumulating large amounts of infantry in the Mykolaivka area in preparation for future attacks towards and into eastern Myrnohrad.\n7. Russian forces advanced into the treelines and fortifications directly north of Myrnohrad, however no consolidation has occurred yet, likely due to the lack of control over the mine area and the difficult situation further west. Russia is also accumulating large forces in the Novoekonomichne area in preparation for attempts to clear the grey zone and break into northeastern Myrnohrad. \n8. Following the end of the fierce battles for the pig farms and surrounding positions south of Rodynske, over the past 5 days Ukrainian forces have launched a series of counterattacks on the Russian flanks. They advanced from the city of Rodynske, back into western Chervonyi Lyman, where they were able to secure the western houses of the village. Fighting is ongoing for the central part. Other forces are attempting to clear the treelines south of the settlement, where a grey zone has now formed. Meanwhile, further north, Ukrainian forces are continuing their attempts at re-entering Sukhetske, but have been unsuccessful so far. \nOverall, the situation remains very difficult and complicated for the Ukrainians. A severe lack of manpower and important positions being lost west of Pokrovsk points towards a worsening situation down the line, which could involve one of the last remaining roads into the city being bro",

Other forces were able to cross the river over the E-150 Highway, and capture positions on the southern bank around the overpass. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued their attempts at infiltrating southern Stepnohirsk from the 3rd Microdistrict, however Ukrainian drone coverage is preventing them from consolidating.

They were able to advance into the forested areas to the north, and the treelines to the northwest, taking up new positions there. DRGs also began infiltrating north up the road and have reached the southern outskirts of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. Other forces began advancing up the gulley in the direction of Hruzke, while the Ukrainians attempt to gain a foothold in the positions to the rear. \nTo the south, Russian forces advanced downhill from the tactical heights into the forested areas, improving their positions in the direction of Shakhove. Other forces continued their attacks towards the western outskirts of Shakhove, but continue to be repelled by the Ukrainian garrison. \nAdditionally, to the west, the frontline was corrected, with Vilne now being in the grey zone. Last week, some Russian soldiers were able to enter part of the village but were unable to consolidate. The village was not brought under control, unlike what I previously stated. However, Russian forces are attempting to advance from the treelines to the southwest in the direction of Vilne, but it is unclear if they have had any successes. \nOn the other hand, Ukrainian forces continued their counterattacks in the Druzhkivka direction and have eliminated the Russian spearhead to Sofiivka. They were able to clear the northern and northeastern outskirts of the village, and began advancing west down a treeline, while other forces pushed south down the treelines to the north. Once these positions were recaptured, the Ukrainians began attacking towards the groves to the southeast, infiltrating towards the Russian positions along the western bank of the reservoir. Russian FAB/KAB glide-bombs are targeting these areas, but the majority of them miss the positions (by up to 250 metres) and fall in the fields. \nTo the south, Russian forces are also continuing their attacks under artillery and FPV drone cover through the gulley towards the Ukrainian strongpoints, but their advance is being impeded by Ukrainian FPV drone strikes. They have been unable to make any progress here for some time now. \n+ ~5.15 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~5.12 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

Now, invisible battles are being fought on the fields of the World Wide Web.
