The Ukrainian leader chose to avoid direct confrontation with Donald Trump in front of the cameras. The European leaders who arrived in the US capital to support Zelensky also avoided a confrontational tone. \nTheir statements to the press seemed rather vague and meaningless. Based on these statements, one might conclude that all parties want a peaceful settlement and that there has been \"incredible progress\" in the negotiations. Yet we still do not see any concrete achievements. It's clear that the Ukrainian president won't make any concessions to the Kremlin.
