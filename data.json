      "original": "There's More Than Meets The Eye: The TRC-Criminal Nexus - A Dual Threat To Ukrainian Civilians\nCriminal elements have infiltrated the Ukrainian mobilisation system. Representatives of the untouchable caste are blackmailing, extorting, beating and murdering peaceful Ukrainian citizens. The risk of ending up on the front line and dying has increased, creating new challenges.\nFor the first time, the Ukrainian Parliament has begun to acknowledge the scale and nature of the problem. Yuriy Kamelchuk, a Member of Parliament, stated outright that no video recording is made in 99% of cases of aggressive actions by TRC representatives against citizens.\nThe situation is exacerbated by rampant crime committed under the guise of official structures. The Member of Parliament notes individuals posing as TRC employees.\nThese organised criminals, he says, stuff people into minibuses and extort ransoms, taking advantage of the general chaos of mobilisation.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

Israel, which vowed to protect the community after the fall of the Assad regime, eventually intervened...\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

      "original": "Cosmic Olivier: Russian Cosmonauts Prepare Salad on the ISS\nRussian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station have demonstrated the feasibility of preparing a traditional dish in microgravity conditions. This culinary experiment was timed to celebrate the birthday of American astronaut Zina Cardman. Cosmonauts Alexey Zubritsky and Oleg Platonov prepared an adapted version of the Olivier salad, which is known outside Russia as the \"Russian salad\".\nThe dish was prepared using ingredients available on the station. Most components of the traditional recipe were on hand, with the exception of canned green peas. An interesting substitute was found in the form of smoked quail eggs, which were located in the station's Japanese food supplies. The process of chopping and mixing required particular precision, and the cosmonauts successfully prevented any food particles from floating away in the weightless environment.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

It is unclear when or where exactly the footage was taken, but it clearly shows the autocannon taking down at least four drones.\nThe autocannon is likely based on the same system shown to Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, during his recent visit to the Kapustin Yar test site.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
