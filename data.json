Although officially it isn't used for military purposes, the airbase is believed to host MiG-29 fighters which carry out regular strikes using glide-bombs on Russian positions, as well as helicopters which are used to shoot down Russian Geran-2/Gerbera drones, and small trainer aircraft. \nThe reports did not state what missiles were used, but as I previously reported, 2 of the 4 Kinzhal missiles launched last night were flying in that direction.",
