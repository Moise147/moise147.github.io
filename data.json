This was done by attacking in two places. The main assaults were carried out from Komyshuvakha and positions to the north. Here, Russian forces advanced from the village to the outskirts of Ternove, and along the heights to the gulley running southeast from Sosnivka, securing full control over the heights and establishing themselves in the low-lying ground. \nWith the Ukrainians now behind the gulley and unable to effectively counterattack, Russian reinforcements were brought into Vorone, which began attacking from their newly consolidated positions to the Khoroshe Tract, capturing it, and breaking into the northeastern houses of Sosnivka. At the same time, Russian forces entered Sosnivka from the southeast after capturing the eastern edge of the gulley and quickly captured the majority of the village. Currently the northwestern houses are in the grey-zone. Ukrainian soldiers trying to enter it in small groups. \nMeanwhile, north of the Vorona River, Russian forces advanced from their newly consolidated positions northeast of Vorone, advancing northwest along the heights to the southern edge of Novoselivka. They were able to quickly enter the village and establish control over the southern streets, while other forces from the gulley to the north captured the northern houses, bringing the settlement under full Russian control. Additionally, as a result of these advances, the Ukrainians had to abandon the village of Sichneve to avoid being encircled and retreated more than 6 km west to positions north of Sosnivka. \n+ ~33.20 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

Ukrainian soldiers have also been attempting to infiltrate into northern Novotoretske in small groups.  \nRussian forces continued to recapture previously lost positions on the western flank of their salient after the Ukrainians failed to cut them off. They advanced west to the eastern outskirts of Nove Shakhove, capturing treeline positions, and re-entered the northern part of the Hektova Balka Gulley. They also continued to attack west through Nykanorivka.\nAdditionally, the frontline was corrected further west. Sometime in the past 3 weeks, Russia was able to recapture the village of Doroznje and the freight train station of the same name, entrenching in positions there. Due to a lack of positions, Ukrainian forces withdrew over 3 km west, resulting in a large grey zone forming covered by Ukrainian FPV drones. Russian DRGs are actively operating here, attempting to reach the ventilation shafts for the Bilytska Coal Mine (where the current forwards Ukrainian positions are), and have entered the northeastern and eastern streets of Bilytske where Ukrainian forces have been trying to clear them out. \n+ ~14.80 km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine. \n+ ~3.64 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
