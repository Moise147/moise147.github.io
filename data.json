Fierce fighting ensued for around 24 hours, with the Russians being forced to retreat south due to the loss of Vesele and Hruzke, as well as because of Ukraine's numerical superiority here. Those same forces then pushed south and have reached the northern outskirts of Kucheriv Yar. \nAdditionally, after days of positional battles, Ukrainian forces pushed east from their positions in Rubizhne, and recaptured the rest of the village, which Russia had to withdraw from due to the loss of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. From there, Ukrainian forces pushed further and captured treeline positions on the nearby tactical heights, and in the gulley leading south from Zolotyi Kolodyaz.\nTo the south, the Ukrainians pushed outwards from Stepy, establishing a buffer zone in the treelines on the tactical heights there, while other forces moved along the heights to Vilne, which also came under their control.\nFurthermore, Ukrainian forces advanced east from Novyi Donbas, and entered the village of Nove Shakhove, capturing the western houses. They were also able to recapture the village of Ivanivka, as well as  Dorozhnje, which allowed for them to re-enter Nykanorivka which is now partially in the grey zone. \nRussian forces on the other hand, were able to improve their positions west of Shakhove around a week ago, advancing downhill through two parallel gulleys, capturing positions in the forest plantations there. \n+ ~60.60km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~6.78km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

While the claims of large groups of Russians being encircled are likely false, Deepstate and Azov were correct in saying that Ukraine was able to significantly advance. I doubted them, and I was wrong. \nNow let's see what happens in these areas where Ukrainian reinforcements were pulled from, namely the Kostyantynivka direction.

Entire towns and neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble. \n0:00: The video starts off showing the Gaza Port and what used to be adjacent densely populated neighbourhoods. \n0:42: It then pans out to show much of the Shujaiyya, Al-Tuffah, and Zeitoun neighbourhoods completely flattened. This is where a lot of the fighting is ongoing now. \n1:03: We then see the former Netzarim Corridor, where only buildings occupied by the IDF remain standing. Everything else was bulldozed.\n2:09: Crossing over the Wadi Gaza River, you see the damaged Al-Nuseirat and Bureij Refugee Camps. These are areas in which Hamas maintains a level of civil authority and has regrouped many of their fighters. \n3:27: We then move over to the city of Deir Al-Balah, arguably the most \"untouched\" part of Gaza. This is where many civilians have fled, and while there is obviously a humanitarian crisis, life goes on more normally here than in other places.\n4:17: As the plane moves further south, the town of Al-Qarara comes into view, which is now largely flattened due to recent IDF activity. \n4:38: The rubble of Khan Younis and then Rafah are also visible in the distance, with the massive expanse of tents and shelters in the Al-Mawasi \"humanitarian zone\" in the foreground.",

Argentina And UK Secret Military Ties To Counter China In The South Atlantic\nThe South Atlantic, a region often overlooked in global geopolitics, is quietly becoming a theater of strategic maneuvering, with Britain and Argentina engaging in underreported military dialogue to counter Chinese influence. This development, driven by Argentine President Javier Milei‚Äôs pro-Western pivot, could reshape Latin America‚Äôs geopolitical landscape, bolster the US-led West‚Äôs position in the Southern Cone, and even ripple into the BRICS alliance.\nAccording to an Economist¬†piece, Britain and Argentina have resumed defense talks after years of estrangement, spurred by Milei‚Äôs unorthodox stance on the Falklands and concerns about China‚Äôs growing footprint in the South Atlantic.\nArgentina currently seeks to modernize its dilapidated armed forces with NATO-compatible equipment, while Britain is considering loosening its stringent arms export restrictions.\nRead more \nHERE",
