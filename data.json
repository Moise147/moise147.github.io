Netanyahu has agreed to this plan, and Hamas has stated that they are looking over it. \nThe plan includes the following main points:\n1: Gaza will be a \"terror-free\" zone, meaning that militants from Hamas, and organisations fighting alongside Hamas such as the PIJ, PFLP, DFLP, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, etc, would have to leave the strip.\n2. Gaza will be \"redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza\". \n3. The war will immediately end in all sectors, including artillery and air bombardment. IDF forces will withdraw to the yellow line shown on the map. (Please note that the current control line shown on Trump's map is completely wrong). A staged withdrawal will begin once conditions are met. \n4. 72 hours later, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be handed over to Israel.\n5. After the hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners, as well as 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th, 2023, including all women and children. Additionally, for every Israeli hostage whose body is released, Israel will release the bodies of 15 deceases Gazans. \n6. After the hostage exchanges, all Hamas members who commit to \"peaceful co-existence\" and to decommission their weapons will be allowed safe passage out of the Gaza Strip to receiving countries. It is unknown if this will include members from other, Hamas-aligned organisations in Gaza. \n7. Full aid will then be sent to the Gaza Strip without interference, through the UN and its agencies, the red crescent, and other international institutions not associated with either party. The Rafah Border Crossing will also be opened, which the map below shows would be under IDF occupation.\n8. Gaza will be governed under a temporary, transitional government. It will be made up of \"qualified Palestinians\" and international experts and supervised by a new international transitional body headed by Trump. \n9. The Palestinian Authority will undergo a reform program. Once it has completed this, it will regain control over the Gaza Strip.\n10. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, but those who wish to can move to and from the strip.\n11. All military-related infrastructure in the Gaza Strip will be demolished and not rebuilt. \n12. The UN will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force to immediately deploy to Gaza. It will train and provide support to Palestinian police forces in Gaza, as well as help secure Gaza's borders. \n13. The IDF will remain in the small perimeter zone shown on the map until Gaza is properly secured from any resurgence. \n14. An \"interfaith dialogue\" process will be established to change the mindsets of Palestinians and Israelis towards peace and co-existence. \n15. While Gaza is redeveloping and the PA is carrying out its reform program, there is a possibility for the recognition of a Palestinian state.",

      "original": "In the Lyman direction, Russian forces continued to make significant progress, capturing numerous new key positions on a wide front.\nIn the north, after repelling Ukrainian attacks into Shandryholove, Russian forces advanced beyond the Nitrius River and captured the forested areas at the base of a gulley, and began their attacks towards the forests to the south. They were also able to secure the treeline running north of the gulley, connecting this bridgehead with the larger front further north.\nTo the south, after consolidating in the agricultural complex, Russian forces pushed into the northern part of the forest north of Novoselivka, and began attacking west towards the larger forest. Other forces advanced over the Nitrius River, and established control over all of northern Novoselivka. These assault groups began pushing north to the first forest, squeezing the Ukrainians out from their positions against the western bank of the large reservoir. From there, they began pushing further west through the forests, with extensive FPV drone strikes working on the Ukrainian positions, supply routes, and distribution points ahead of them. Further south, assault operations began towards the centre of Novoselivka, where the grey zone has expanded. \nIn the southeast, Russian forces continued to incrementally advance south down the Shandryholove - Drobysheve Road, and have now branched off onto the perpendicular treeline on the northern approaches to Drobysheve. Further east, after prolonged heavy fighting, the Russians broke through the remaining Ukrainian positions in the forests east of Derylove, and with help from forces in the western houses of the settlement, managed to squeeze the Ukrainians out of the centre, before occupying the positions in the forest plantations directly south of the village. \nAdditionally, Russian forces began a coordinated effort to secure the northeastern approaches to Drobysheve. Attacks were carried out towards the next treeline over from Derylove. Once this was occupied, they began storming Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley from the west, and the foothold from the northeast, where heavy battles are still ongoing. \n+ ~9.19 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "In the Lyman direction, Russian forces continued to advance towards Lyman from the east, making important progress in and around Zarichne.\nIn the south, Russian forces continued to push west through the forest south of Zarichne, and reached its western edge. The newly captured positions in this forest were then used as staging grounds to advance to, and capture positions in the southern houses of Zariche. These positions have since been linked up to the initial Russian bridgehead over the Zherebets River in southeastern Zarichne, resulting in large parts of the grey zone being cleared and a salient forming. Ukrainian forces are still moving in and out of the grey zone via the industrial zone in the southwest of the village, but Russia's grip on this area is becoming increasingly tight.\nFurther north, Russian forces finally cleared out the rest of northern Zarichne, and occupied the Ukrainian positions in the agricultural buildings on the western outskirts. From there, they began pushing northwest through the forests up the gulley and have almost cut off the Ukrainian garrison in Myrne. Attacks were also carried out up the western bank of the Zherebets River, as well to the trenches on the northern edge of Myrne. \nIn the northwest, Russian forces resumed their assault operations towards Stavky from the northeast and were able to capture new positions in three separate treelines.\n+ ~9.51 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

From there, they are infiltrating towards the chalk quarry east of Dronivka. As a result of this, Ukraine was forced to withdraw from the village of Serebryanka, and is now holding a defence from three sides in Dronivka. Russian forces have also recaptured the rest of Serebryanka, as well as the surrounding positions, and are now trying to permanently establish themselves in the chalk quarry. \nThe Russians were also able to fully secure the northern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, aligning the front along the Donetsk - Luhansk Regional Border, and officially ending the battles for the Severodonetsk District of Luhansk Oblast which have been ongoing since the first days of the war. \nTo the west, Russian forces marginally advanced towards Dronivka from the west, securing new positions in the forest on the western bank of the Siverskyi Donets River. \nIn the west, Russian forces continued their offensive on Yampil. They were able to consolidate control over additional positions in the eastern part of the village, including at the railway station, and are continuing their attacks beyond the village centre (which is currently in the grey zone). They were also able to advance further west through the forests, establishing control over the railway crossing and surrounding areas.\n+ ~24.46 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

From there, they entered eastern Verbove with little resistance and occupied at least half of the village, including the agricultural buildings. The intensity of FAB glide-bomb strikes in this area is increasing, with Ukrainian temporary deployment points and fortifications constantly being struck.\nAdditionally, Russian forces advanced north from their positions west of Berezove, and captured the one-house \"village\" of Stepove.
