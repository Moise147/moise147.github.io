Russian forces have been slowly pushing towards the northern edge of Doroznje, and were geolocated at the clay mine. Unconfirmed (but plausible) reports state that Doroznje has come back under Russian control, and that Russian forces have re-secured the northern part of Nykanorivka. If true, Ukrainian forces are at great risk of being encircled here. \nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued to attack. They have entered the centre of Boikivka, and carried out unsuccessful attacks on northern Zatyshok after advancing down a treeline in the grey zone. Russian forces are slowly pushing the Ukrainians back out of northern Novotoretske, and continue their attacks on western Nove Shakhove.",

Russian forces pushed northwest to the main section of the eastern part of Ivanivka, capturing additional positions in the houses there and along the northern bank of the Vovcha River. \n+ ~2.76 km² in favour of Russia.",

Ukrainian reinforcements were brought in and kill-zones with FPV drones were formed in the low-rise residential areas. As a result, despite incredibly intense FAB glide-bomb and artillery bombardment of Rodynske and the surrounding areas, Russia failed to breach Ukrainian lines here. \nUkrainian forces in turn began their own series of counterattacks. Utilising their superior forward deployment points in stronger and larger high-rise buildings, the Ukrainians cleared Russian soldiers from the eastern and northern parts of the city, as well as the area of the train station. \nMeanwhile, Russian forces continued their attacks in the area of the highway, near the pig farms south of Rodynske.\n+ ~1.64 km² in favour of Ukraine.",
