They were also able to make further progress to the north, capturing two treelines, and gaining a foothold in the forest plantations on the southeastern approaches to Shakhove.\nMeanwhile, despite widespread reports, Volodymyrivka is not under Russian control. The Russians control the southern part of the village, and have not properly consolidated in the centre due to constant Ukrainian drone strikes. After the Russians broke into Volodymyrivka, Ukraine resorted to covering almost the entire village with FPV drones and artillery, striking anything that moves, which resulted in much of the initial Russian assault groups being killed or wounded. Additional reinforcements have managed to enter the village, and new attacks are now underway towards the northern streets. Ukrainian forces currently control a single street in the north of the village, which is constantly being hit by Russian FPV drones. Ukrainian movement to and from these positions is incredibly difficult. \nAdditionally, Russian forces are continuing their assault operations towards the Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley east of Sofiivka, but are still having no success due to constant Ukrainian drone and artillery strikes. \n+ ~3.16 km² in favour of Russia.",

All of these positions are on the tactical heights, allowing for the Russians to increase their presence above Ivanopillya from the east. \nAdditionally, due to repeated Ukrainian FPV drone and mortar strikes, and a lack of stable supply, Russian forces withdrew from most of the dachas southeast of Kostyantynivka.
