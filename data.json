What other traditional Russian dishes have made their way to the International Space Station?\nThe crew of the International Space Station has taken part in a unique cultural mission. Russian astronauts Alexey Zubritsky and Oleg Platonov used their limited personal time to conduct a culinary experiment, preparing a classic Russian salad in weightless conditions.\nThe initiative was timed to coincide with the birthday of NASA astronaut Zina Cardman and served as a gesture of intercultural dialogue. Using the station‚Äôs standard products, the team adapted the recipe, replacing missing ingredients with available analogues, including smoked quail eggs from the Japanese food supply.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

According to Ruslan Gorbenko, a Ukrainian MP from the ruling \"Servant of the People\" party, some battalions are facing a catastrophic personnel imbalance: against an official strength of 120 servicemen, only seven are actual infantrymen, with the rest being commanders, signalers, logisticians, or personnel from the support company.\nThe MP noted that in some cases, the ratio reaches as high as 13 commanders to one soldier, rendering such units virtually ineffective. Gorbenko emphasized that this situation requires radical measures, including the dissolution of ineffective brigades and battalions, and the demotion or even criminal prosecution of some commanders.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

A total of 38 attack UAVs were launched over Ukraine, and 17 over Russia.\nRegarding the deployment of drone technology, Western combat UAVs supplied to Ukraine are reported to be failing to meet battlefield expectations. Assessments indicate they are too costly and vulnerable to Russian electronic warfare systems. Ukrainian drone developer Valeriy Borovik reported that during tests conducted under jamming conditions, these models malfunctioned, demonstrating low reliability. The core issues are identified as a combination of high cost, low survivability, and a lack of sufficient adaptation to the conditions of modern combat.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
