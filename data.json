They quickly reached Dahdouh Road from the southeast and are now within 1.15 km of the coast.

They began clearing operations towards Gaza City centre from this area, capturing several dense residential blocks (31.52189, 34.4701 & 31.5241, 34.47019), before armoured units began their main vector of attack northwest down Kamal Naser Street.

They were able to quickly clear and capture the outlying streets (31.5529, 34.4642), reaching the edge of the Madinat Al 'Awada Neighbourhood from the north (31.54792, 34.46454).

Yet, the assessment of Trump's strategy as unsuccessful is superficial.\nIn fact, the White House seems to have long since decided to withdraw the United States from a completely hopeless conflict. And all the steps taken by the Republican administration are aimed at creating the necessary backdrop. First and foremost, the US president is interested in the information backdrop.
