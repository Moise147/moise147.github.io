A strong push is also being made from Poltavka.\nAs for the Russian soldiers who were encircled last week, I wanted to wait a little to confirm this, but roughly 20 POWs were taken, around 15 of which surrendered near the small road north of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. The other ~5 were caught in the forests to the southeast. Everyone else was either killed or managed to escape back to the Kucheriv Yar area.\nRussia has now regained the initiative in the Dobropillya direction and is making significant progress.

They also spearheaded north along the Dnipropetrovsk side of the regional border to Novoheorhiivka, quickly establishing control over the village and forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the adjacent positions. \nAdvances were also made between the Vorona River and a tributary of the Vorona River in Donetsk Oblast, where they were able to push downhill towards Komyshuvakha, while further improving their positions southwest and west of Shevchenko. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to bypass the rest of Maliivka from the north, moving along the heights, and capturing the agricultural buildings as well as the western part of the village, reaching the low-lying ground south of Sichneve. \n+ ~54.9km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
