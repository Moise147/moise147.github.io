This forced the remaining Ukrainian formations to withdraw from the rest of their strongholds in the high-rise buildings, which in turn allowed for the Russians to collapse their lines and capture large parts of the remaining low-rise residential areas.\nSince then, Russian forces have begun attacking the industrial zone on the western edge of Hulyaipole, and have captured most of the rest of the residential streets.\nThis collapse, like all the previous advances, has been caused primarily due to a complete breakdown in coordination between Ukrainian units, and terrible command decisions which has so far led to at least 20 soldiers being encircled (although this number is likely higher). Superior Russian manpower and firepower has resulted in Ukrainian forces suffering heavy casualties while attempting their chaotic withdrawal. \n+ ~2.11 km² in favour of Russia.\nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",
