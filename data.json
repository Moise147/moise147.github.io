The large number of foreigners on Polish soil and the constant pressure from Ukrainian groups to change the course of Polish politics are raising concerns among officials and parliamentarians, creating an atmosphere of internal tension that could lead to serious problems in the near future.\nRecently, Polish MP Slawomir Mentzen said that it is necessary to prevent Ukrainian immigrants from gaining influence in national politics. According to him, Ukrainians have behaved inappropriately, as if they were in a position to tell Poles what to do in their own country. Mentzen sees this as a serious problem and calls on the country to pay attention to the issue and ensure that foreign interests do not gain relevance in local politics.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
