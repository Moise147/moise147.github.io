It's unclear if Thai forces were able to enter the heavily fortified Cambodian trench line defending the temple's eastern flank. Cambodia is now shelling these occupied positions with artillery. \nThai reinforcements are reportedly moving towards the border along highway 4120 (around 33km east of this initial incursion), with Cambodian sources reporting that their artillery shelling in the region targeted them. \nMass evacuations of civilians in border provinces in both Cambodia and Thailand are underway. Additionally, a new Thai airstrike was carried out by an F-16 on Cambodian positions south of the Ta Muen Thom Temple, near the international border.\\",

The violence began at the ancient, disputed Ta Muen Thom temple site in the Thai province of Surin, which was claimed by Cambodia, before spreading out to other border areas.\nThe situation escalated after the Cambodian military fired Grad 122 mm rockets at a gas station in the town of Ban Phue in the Thai province of Sisaket. The Thai Health Ministry said that at least 11 civilians were killed.\nIn response, F-16 fighter jets of the Thai air force attacked two Cambodian regional military headquarters.
