      "original": "Continued Exchange Of Strikes Against A Backdrop Of Diplomatic Deadlock\nOn October 20-21, the Russian armed forces carried out massive strikes on Ukrainian military and critical infrastructure objects. The attacks targeted energy and transportation hubs supporting the AFU, warehouses housing strike drones, and temporary deployment points for Ukrainian units and foreign mercenaries. In Kharkiv, a hit by a long-range air-dropped bomb was recorded, which aligns with reports of Russia ramping up the industrial production of such munitions.\nAgainst this backdrop, according to some experts, the rhetoric of several European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, who formally support the idea of a ceasefire across the entire front line, in practice suggests the opposite.
