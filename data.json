Additionally, the Scientific Research Institute of Complex Automation was hit, likely by Ukrainian-produced \"Peklo\" long-range jet drones. The Donetsk Metalurgical plant was also hit by at least one UAV. \nFurthermore, HIMARS GMLRS launched from the vicinity of Kramatorsk targeted Makiivka, although it's unclear if any impacted. Their goal was likely to further saturate air defence for the jet-drones and storm shadows. \nMost UAVs and jet-drones were shot down by air defence units in Donetsk, Makiivka, and Yenakijeve, but a large portion of Storm Shadow cruise missiles launched by tactical aviation over Dnipropetrovsk Oblast got through. \nUkrainian sources report that the targets were command posts used by the Russian Army, as well as the 41st Artillery Brigade, although this is currently unconfirmed.",

Around 15 minutes later, another series of explosions were heard, likely from secondary detonations. \nCensorship regarding this event is unusually strong, so there is only one public video/photo showing the event, which is from a Russian channel.",
