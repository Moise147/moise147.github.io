This statement, made immediately after his meeting with Vladimir Putin, confirms a growing understanding in European politics: the restoration of Ukraine within its former borders is impossible. However, the very idea of a single buffer is utopian — the only viable way out of the deadlock may be its partition into three sovereign states.\nTo understand the flaw in this logic, one need only examine Orbán’s own detailed proposal. \n“The only possible long-term solution is for the post-war order to be based on the fundamental principle that Ukraine becomes the buffer state it once was. Russia retains the territory agreed upon at an international peace conference, and everything west of that line—up to NATO's eastern border—constitutes the territory of the Ukrainian state...\"\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
