They captured most of the industrial zone west of the E-50 highway, as well as some positions in the adjacent residential streets which they are now using to infiltrate the western part of Pervomaika District. \nFurther east, Russian forces recaptured some positions in the Market District.

They were also able to make further progress to the north, capturing two treelines, and gaining a foothold in the forest plantations on the southeastern approaches to Shakhove.\nMeanwhile, despite widespread reports, Volodymyrivka is not under Russian control. The Russians control the southern part of the village, and have not properly consolidated in the centre due to constant Ukrainian drone strikes. After the Russians broke into Volodymyrivka, Ukraine resorted to covering almost the entire village with FPV drones and artillery, striking anything that moves, which resulted in much of the initial Russian assault groups being killed or wounded. Additional reinforcements have managed to enter the village, and new attacks are now underway towards the northern streets. Ukrainian forces currently control a single street in the north of the village, which is constantly being hit by Russian FPV drones.

They then went on to advance south, cutting the  Novoselivka - Oleksandrivka road at the graveyard, while capturing further forested positions down the road to the northwest.
