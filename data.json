Ukrainian forces, utilising the trench fortifications in the forest to the north were able to hold the northern part of the settlement, and launched a few counterattacks, however these were repelled. Russian forces responded by dropping several FAB glide-bombs on this forest. \nTo the east, Ukrainian forces continued their slow advance towards Dachne. They completed the capture of the forest west of the village, and secured positions in the treeline to the east. Other forces then advanced south from the treelines in the area of the highway and captured the large trench fortification on the northern approaches to the village. This fortification was then used to enter Dachne, where they captured the western houses.
