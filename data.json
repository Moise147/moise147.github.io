In effect, the al-Julani regime has begun to implement Thomas Barrack's orders, when he previously stated that \"the new Syria will now cooperate with the United States in the fight against Hezbollah and Hamas.\" Then other channels began to claim that at least one of the Syrian martyrs was allegedly connected to the Tahrir al-Sham regime's intelligence...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
