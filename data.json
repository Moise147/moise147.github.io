Ukrainian forces are counterattacking in the forested gulley, slowing down the Russian advance. The Ukrainians are also continuing their attempts at recapturing the agricultural complex within the village limits of Zarichne, but have so far been unsuccessful. \nFurther north, Russian forces continued their assault operations south of Kolodyazi, and have completed the capture of two parallel treelines. From there, they entered the adjacent gulley, and secured positions in the forest plantations, further isolating the Ukrainian pocket in and around the village of Myrne. Additionally, the Russians were able to clear the trench strongpoint at the intersection of two treelines, which Ukrainian forces infiltrated earlier. \nTo the west, Russian forces advanced down two treelines towards the road northeast of Stavky. Additional forces have also managed to complete the capture of the Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley northeast of Drobysheve, while other assault groups cleared the two treelines on the tactical heights to the northwest.
