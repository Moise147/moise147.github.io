Ironically, these \"patriots\" are the same people who called for no more foreign wars prior to this, but that's a whole other story. \nAnd yes, while Maduro may not have been popular among Venezuelans, and a large amount of people may be happy that he's gone, the U.S. attacks are bigger than just this. \nAnyone who knows a bit about the very lengthy history of the U.S. carrying out regime changes will understand how this is not a good thing, no matter how happy Venezuelans are that Maduro is gone. This is bigger than just Venezuela. The U.S. is a great power furthering its own interests, as it has done for the last century. It recognises the difficult and worsening situation it is in with the current multipolar state of the world, and this is just one action of a larger interconnected web of geostrategic moves.",
