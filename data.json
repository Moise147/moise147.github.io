People unironically use Deepstate (under heavy Ukrainian government influence) or Azov's official page to update their maps. \nThose same people will then go on to criticise people like me for showing Russian advances based on satellite imagery, Ukrainian sources, and Russian sources!\nThe disconnect from reality in the Pro-Ukraine community is beyond insane due to the desperate need for a victory - no matter how small/insignificant. You will go to extreme lengths to \"disprove\" any Russian successes, but then as soon as there are a couple of dubious claims about Ukraine slightly advancing, it's taken at face value - no questions asked (the same goes for Pro-Russians too btw).\nThis is one of those things I could rant on and on about because I am Pro-Ukraine, so naturally I see so much of this in my feed.",
