Keep in mind, interception rates are likely higher. \nIn addition to the missiles, hundreds of Geran-2, Geran-3, and Gerbera drones were launched, and as of the time of writing there are still approximately 90 still detected in Ukrainian airspace, flying to attack Kyiv Oblast. \nThe main targets for this attack were:\nKyiv City, Kyiv Oblast\nBila Tserkva, Kyiv Oblast\nBohuslav, Kyiv Oblast\nVasylkiv, Kyiv Oblast\nIrpin, Kyiv Oblast\nBilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa Oblast\nStarokostyantyniv, Khmelnytskyi Oblast\nKonotop, Sumy Oblast\nZaporizhzhia City, Zaporizhzhia Oblast",
