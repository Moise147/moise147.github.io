Deep advances were made along the gulley on the Dnipropetrovsk - Zaporizhzhia Regional Border, with Russian forces approaching the rear of Novohryhorivka. \nIn Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, after taking Novomykolaivka, Russian forces stormed the eastern outskirts of Kalynivske, while aviation and artillery worked on the main Ukrainian defensive nodes in the area. This collapsed the Ukrainian defense of the flanks and allowed for the Russians to quickly take the lightly defended village of Kalynivske, as well as the adjacent fortifications. The fall of Kalynivske allowed for Russian forces to push along the treelines on the tactical heights to the south, and level the front south of Kalynivske. They were also able to capture positions northwest and north of Kalynivka in the forests and treelines in the low-lying ground, approaching Stepove from the south. \nIn the north, Russian forces continued to develop their offensive in the area of Sosnivka. They were able to capture another treeline north of Berestove, and secured a series of treeline intersections northwest of Ternove, forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal from the salient south of Sosnivka. \n+ ~39.80 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

The Tu-160 was equipped with missiles at Ukrainka, while the Tu-95MS has since been equipped at Engels-2 and is currently in the air, flying to Olenya Airbase. Thus, 6 Tu-95MS bombers and 1 Tu-160 bomber are known to be equipped with cruise missiles. \nInterestingly, the Black Sea Fleet has seemingly completed loading of Kalibr cruise missiles before the completion of Tu-95MS/160 preparations, despite possible delays from Ukraine's UAV attacks on Novorossiysk Naval Base in Krasnodar Krai. \nAdditionally, Geran-2/3 and Gerbera drone accumulation has been continuing as normal, with daily Geran-2/3drone launches not exceeding 100 since the last attack. \nThe most likely time for a missile attack is the night of 28 September to the morning of the 29 September, but it could even take place as early as tonight.",

Ukrainian reinforcements were brought in and kill-zones with FPV drones were formed in the low-rise residential areas. As a result, despite incredibly intense FAB glide-bomb and artillery bombardment of Rodynske and the surrounding areas, Russia failed to breach Ukrainian lines here. \nUkrainian forces in turn began their own series of counterattacks.
