Are people really that impatient?\nThis should go without saying, but Ukraine achieving limited successes on the battlefield, or with drone strikes, is not a new phenomenon, and it doesn't make it any less real than Russian successes. Besides, in an attritional war like this it's about who can achieve the most successes and who can sustain their efforts for the longest. Both of those are well in favour of Russia.",

Here they will probably be equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles, as Belaya Airbase hasn't been used for equipment of missile since Ukraine's operation spiderweb on June 1, 2025. \nAdditionally, 1 Tu-95MS departed from Olenya Airbase and is still airborne. The purpose of the flight is currently unclear, but it might be conducting training with simulated launch maneuvers. \nThe two Tu-95s that redeployed from Olenya Airbase to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast, on August 31 are still there being equipped with missiles. Once they return, the total number of equipped aircraft stationed at Olenya and Engels-2 Airbases will rise to 6 (4 Tu-95s and 2 Tu-160s).",
