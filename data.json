Although officially it isn't used for military purposes, the airbase is believed to host MiG-29 fighters which carry out regular strikes using glide-bombs on Russian positions, as well as helicopters which are used to shoot down Russian Geran-2/Gerbera drones, and small trainer aircraft. \nThe reports did not state what missiles were used, but as I previously reported, 2 of the 4 Kinzhal missiles launched last night were flying in that direction.",

The image shows just one Su-34 out in the open, and construction is still ongoing for additional hangars. \nThese hangars aim to prevent Ukrainian UAVs from damaging or destroying the aircraft stationed here, with similar construction efforts currently ongoing at several other airbases. Currently, aircraft which have dedicated hangars only leave them before takeoff, with all maintenance being carried out inside them. \nThe airbase's warehouse is also visible in the imagery, which stores KAB glide-bombs which are used daily by the Su-34s to strike frontline targets in Ukraine. \nImage credit: \nhttps://t.me/StrategicaviationT/17419",
