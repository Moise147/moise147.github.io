      "original": "Overnight, Zaporizhzhia City came under continued attacks by MLRS and KABs. At least 7 more KAB glide-bombs hit targets in the city limits, and on the outskirts, while MLRS shelling targeted the southern suburbs. Geran-2 drones also flew over the city but did not strike anything as they were transiting north. \nStrengthened Ukrainian air defence in Zaporizhzhia is showing its effects. At least four Gerans have been shot down, along with two glide-bombs. \nAdditionally, targets from the previous attacks were identified. The auto-repair shop at 47.82259, 35.14838 was hit, along with the Motor Sich Plant in multiple places. However, electronic warfare seems to be affecting the accuracy of these bombs, as one that intended to hit the auto-repair shop missed by around 40 metres, and another aimed at the Motor Sich plant hit houses around 60 metres away across the street (47.83129, 35.19627).",
