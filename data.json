The “Israeli” occupation of areas in Daraa and the near-total Turkish subjugation of Aleppo further confirm the theory that a Libyan scenario is beginning to unfold in Syria.\nIt is clear why the so-called Ahmed al-Sharaa erased the date 1973 from Syrian memory: he simply wants to continue the policy of groveling before Zionism in the hope that they will not initiate the process of dismantling a united Syria...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
