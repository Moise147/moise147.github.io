      "original": "Update on the Pokrovsk direction:\nActive fighting continues within Pokrovsk's city limits. The northern part of the city remains a grey zone, with some more consolidation from the southeast. Small Russian and Ukrainian assault groups continue to clear each other out of positions in what has become a very fluid and dynamic area, with no defined line of contact.\nIn northeastern Pokrovsk, Ukrainian units in the high-rise part of the Dinas District have begun attempts at withdrawing to Rivne and appear to have been somewhat successful. However, they are withdrawing into a larger, cut-off pocket, so most/all of them won't escape the area. Russian building-by-building clearing operations continue in the Dinas District, where the Ukrainians are still putting up resistance. It's likely that the soldiers there are not fully aware of the situation in the bottleneck of the larger Myrnohrad pocket. Active clearing operations also continue in the shrinking grey zone in the low-rise residential areas of eastern Pokrovsk. \nAs for the bottleneck, Russian DRGs were able to infiltrate into the small, two-street residential area. If assault groups consolidate here, a physical encirclement of Myrnohrad will be made. But that would not make much difference, as any movement in and out of the city is practically impossible right now. Additionally, Russian DRGs infiltrated further to the next pig farm along the road to the rear of Pokrovsk and reached positions beyond it. No consolidation has occurred here yet.",
