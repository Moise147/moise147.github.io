Ukraine failed to cut off the Russians in their salient to Kucheriv Yar and refocused further east after recapturing Volodomyrivka. \nRussia still holds Doroznje, while this map shows it 5 km behind the front line. This map is from someone called \"Shalin\", and the claims are based off Deepstate, old footage, and dubious claims that have been proven false time and time again. \nAlso, I love how they still have it marked as Russia being encircled east of Kucheriv Yar after almost an entire month lmao.",
