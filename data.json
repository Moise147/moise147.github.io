It was unveiled for the first time at the Dronetech Asia 2024 unmanned aerial vehicle exhibition in the city of Bangkok.\nTwo versions of the drone were showcased at the exhibition: the KB-5E which is propelled by an electric engine, and the slightly larger KB-10G that is propelled by a piston engine. Both versions feature a near identical delta-wing shape and can be launched with a catapult or a rocket booster.\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",

      "original": "Did Turkey Really Develop Hypersonic Missile?\nFor the last decade or so, \"hypersonic\" has become the new military buzzword that signifies prestige and technological edge. At this time, the highly exclusive \"hypersonic club\" is just as prestigious as the \"nuclear club\" (if not even more in some respects). Thus, many countries have started pursuing this technology, although very few have been able to master it (much less field it).\nTurkey‚Äôs recent unveiling of the new ‚ÄúTayfun Block-4‚Äù ballistic missile is quite significant in that regard. Although Ankara keeps insisting that the weapon is supposedly ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù, there‚Äôs no evidence to support such claims. The missile‚Äôs maneuverability beyond minor in-flight corrections and adjustments is highly questionable, to put it mildly. The latest ‚ÄúTayfun‚Äù likely has a speed of Mach 5, but this is nowhere near enough to make it ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù.\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",
