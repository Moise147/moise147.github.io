This raises the question once again: \"Has Turkey won in Syria?\" Erdogan, aware of the humiliation he suffered at the hands of Netanyahu, is trying to put a good face on a bad game, compensating for his failures through a policy of forced Turkification on Syrians in the Aleppo region and surrounding areas. Erdogan also needs this move to portray the capture of Aleppo by Devlet Bahçeli's pan-Turkists as a \"victory\" domestically. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
