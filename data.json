      "original": "Russian Army Cuts Key Road Between Krasny Liman And Seversk \nOn October 27, the Russian military cut a key road linking the cities of Krasny Liman and Seversk in the Donetsk direction, putting more pressure on Kiev forces.\nThe road was reportedly blocked by the Yug [South] Group of Forces in the Medovy Forest, close to Dibrova to the south of Krasny Liman. This means that Russian troops may be situated around one kilometer, or even less, from the southern entrance of the city.\nWhile the road was cut close to Krasny Liman, Kiev forces in Seversk took the bigger hit. Without the road, sending supplies to the city will be far more complicated. It‚Äôs worth noting that the city is already facing much pressure from Russian troops, who are advancing to the north and south of it.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
