Pro-Ukrainian copers have to cope with the fact that Ukraine is losing, but this makes no sense. Are people really that impatient?\nThis should go without saying, but Ukraine achieving limited successes on the battlefield, or with drone strikes, is not a new phenomenon, and it doesn't make it any less real than Russian successes. Besides, in an attritional war like this it's about who can achieve the most successes and who can sustain their efforts for the longest. Both of those are well in favour of Russia.",

Once they return, the total number of equipped aircraft stationed at Olenya and Engels-2 Airbases will rise to 6 (4 Tu-95s and 2 Tu-160s).",
