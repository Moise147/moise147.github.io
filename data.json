They expanded to the streets to the northwest and southeast, and managed to cross the river via the destroyed road bridge, establishing a foothold in the city centre in the court buildings, auto repair shop, and towards the city hospital complex. \nIn the eastern part of Hulyaipole, Russian forces finally managed to consolidate in the easternmost streets and in the animal farms, and crossed the Haichur River from Krasna Street, linking up with assault groups from the east. From there, they pushed west along Velyka Street and Vrozhaina Street, reaching the local university. \nTo the northwest, Russian forces advanced down the treelines to the wastewater treatment plant and landfill, before pushing west and entering the northernmost streets of Hulyaipole. They were able to consolidate there and push the Ukrainians across the Haichur River. A number of Ukrainian formations are still present north of the river in the area of Naberezhna Street, however, but are surrounded on 3 sides.\nTo the north, Russian forces continued to incrementally advance towards Varvarivka and captured additional treeline positions on the western face of the tactical heights. \n+ ~19.58 km² in favour of Russia.",

They also bypassed the 40th District from the west via the low-rise residential areas and are attempting to link up with assault groups in the northwestern streets of Myrnohrad.\nIn the northeastern part of Myrnohrad, Russian forces broke through to the terykon, captured the garage cooperatives, and linked up with assault groups in District 5-23, who cleared additional high-rise buildings and the fire station. As a result, a few dozen Ukrainian soldiers have been cut off from the main encirclement and are trapped in several apartment buildings in the Svetlyy District. Additionally, the Russians entered the city centre from the south and are clearing the first 3-story-buildings there. They also consolidated in the treeline and the terykon in the fields east of Myrnohrad\nIn the northern part of Myrnohrad, Russian forces continued to advance from the 8th District and captured a large residential area just east of the city centre, where they reached the paintball field. They also secured the low-rise residential area just west/northwest of the Svetlyy District.\nNorthwest of Myrnohrad, Russian forces consolidated in forests on either side of the railway line and entered the former Novator Mine from the west, which remains in the grey-zone.\nSouthwest of Myrnohrad, Russian forces continued to clear out isolated pockets of Ukrainian soldiers in the fields and consolidated in additional treeline positions there.\n+ ~9.83 km² in favour of Russia.",

They also recaptured the rest of the houses west of the Yuvileynyi high-rise micro-district and entered its southern apartment buildings as well as the boarding school. Other forces are now trying to bypass it from the north and enter another garage cooperative, in an attempt to encircle the remaining Russian soldiers in the northern high-rise buildings. \nIn the western part of Kupyansk, the Ukrainians continued to clear the residential blocks west of the railway line and reached the highway. Some assault groups are pushing further east towards the city centre, reaching the gymnasium and the furniture factory. They also managed to advance north from the grain elevators, entering the City Central Hospital and capturing additional positions in the blocks to the west, forcing the remaining Russian formations stations to the northwestern streets to withdraw to the city centre.\nIn the northwestern part of Kupyansk, following the Russian withdrawal, Ukrainian forces quickly established control over large parts of the residential areas there and are now attempting to clear the area of the bread factory and a number of nearby enterprises. Fighting is also ongoing for the \"Comb\" stronghold, which contains 19 high-rise buildings and several other smaller buildings. \nIn the northern part of Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations and finally managed to consolidate on Michurina and Mechnikova Streets, thereby physically cutting all Russian ground supply into the western part of the city. Additionally, they were able to consolidate in new residential areas in and around Lenina Street and entered the city centre from the north where they are trying to clear the Spartak Stadium, School No. 6, and a number of surrounding apartment buildings.\nNorth of Kupyansk, Ukrainian forces captured the rest of the enterprises on the northern outskirts of the city and entered the nearby forests. Additionally, at some point recently, they re-established full control over the village of Radkivka.\nFurther north, Ukrainian forces consolidated in the western streets of Kindrashivka, which were already in the grey-zone. They then consolidated in the treelines north of Kindrashivka and entered the eastern part of the village, forcing the Russian formations stationed there to withdraw east and allowing for the settlement to be brought back under full Ukrainian control. From there, the Ukrainians began a push to the north, recapturing two large forests on either side of the R-79 Highway. \nEast of Kupyansk, over the last week, Russian forces have been carrying out a series of assault operations aimed at eliminating the Ukrainian presence northeast of Kupyansk. They were able to capture the remaining industrial buildings on the eastern edge of the city and began pushing through Ukrainian positions in the forests further east. As a result, the Russians entered the southwestern houses of Kucherivka and captured a large part of the settlement. \nThis forced the remaining Ukrainian formations to withdraw from Synkivka and the nearby areas, officially ending a nearly 2.5-year-long battle for this village, and allowing for the Russians to nearly fully secure the area north of the Hnylytsya River. Additionally, Russian forces managed to consolidate the remaining parts of northern Petropavlivka, while clearing operations continue in the northwestern houses where Ukrainian forces have withdrawn through from Synkivka. \n+ ~13.23 km² in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~9.97 km² in favour of Russia.",
