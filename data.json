It is unclear when or where exactly the footage was taken, but it clearly shows the autocannon taking down at least four drones.\nThe autocannon is likely based on the same system shown to Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, during his recent visit to the Kapustin Yar test site.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

      "original": "Russia Continues Strikes On Ukraine‚Äôs Energy And Transport Sectors, While The EU Faces Challenges In Supporting Kyiv\nIn recent days, Russia and Ukraine have continued exchanging strikes, targeting each other's key infrastructure. The Russian armed forces have concentrated their primary efforts on Ukraine's energy facilities, including wind farms, as well as transport infrastructure‚Äîspecifically, railway trains used for transporting military equipment and weapons to the front lines. In turn, Ukraine once again targeted a dam in the Belgorod region and carried out a drone raid on Moscow.\nThe use of new types of glide bombs with record-breaking range for this class of munition by Russian aviation has sharply increased the destructive force of massive air raids on rear-area targets and placed an additional burden on Ukraine's already depleted forces. \nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
