It's unclear if Thai forces were able to enter the heavily fortified Cambodian trench line defending the temple's eastern flank. Cambodia is now shelling these occupied positions with artillery. \nThai reinforcements are reportedly moving towards the border along highway 4120 (around 33km east of this initial incursion), with Cambodian sources reporting that their artillery shelling in the region targeted them. \nMass evacuations of civilians in border provinces in both Cambodia and Thailand are underway. Additionally, a new Thai airstrike was carried out by an F-16 on Cambodian positions south of the Ta Muen Thom Temple, near the international border.\\",

Commandos of the Mossad spy agency did most of the damage, attacking air defense systems from within Iranian territories with small drones and guided missiles.\nDespite losing multiple large drones, the Israeli Air Force was able to gain aerial superiority over the western and central parts of the Islamic Republic, including the capital of Tehran.\n“Some of our air defenses were damaged, this is not something we can hide, but our colleagues have used domestic resources and replaced them with pre-arranged systems that were stored in suitable locations in order to keep the airspace secure,” Mousavi said\n👉\nRead More\n \nHERE",
