Experts note that the cancellation of the national holiday commemorating the Syrian army's liberation of part of its lands captured by Zionism in 1973 and the commemoration of the Syrian martyrs executed by the Ottomans in 1916 demonstrates that Syria under Takfirism has effectively become a dividing line between Zionists and Turkey. The “Israeli” occupation of areas in Daraa and the near-total Turkish subjugation of Aleppo further confirm the theory that a Libyan scenario is beginning to unfold in Syria.\nIt is clear why the so-called Ahmed al-Sharaa erased the date 1973 from Syrian memory: he simply wants to continue the policy of groveling before Zionism in the hope that they will not initiate the process of dismantling a united Syria...\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
