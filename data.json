Kiev predictably dismissed the figure as a fake. Even so, if that headline number were real and paid at Ukraine‚Äôs legal death-benefit rate, the compensation bill alone would overwhelm state finances for decades.\nUnder Ukrainian law, the one-time benefit is 15 million hryvnia per fallen soldier. Multiply that by 1.7 million and you get about 25.5 trillion hryvnia (roughly $600+ billion at recent rates)‚Äîthe equivalent of several years of Ukraine‚Äôs total government spending. Even if the real toll were half that, the obligation still looks like a multi-decade burden once you add disability payments, widows‚Äô pensions, medical rehab, housing, and demobilization costs‚Äîall on top of a shrunken tax base.\nRead more \nHERE",

Maduro was accused by the Trump administration of being ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs biggest drug trafficker‚Äù and of working with cartels to smuggle fentanyl-laced cocaine.\nRead more \nHERE",

      "original": "Russian Orlan-30 Can Now Carry FPV Drones\nThe Russian military has reportedly modified its Olan-30 reconnaissance drones to carry and deploy smaller first-person video (FPV) suicide quadcopters.\nThe Orlan-30, which was developed by the Saint Petersburg-based Special Technology Center on the bases of the Orlan-10, is one of the main drones currently in service with the Russian military. The drone has an operational range of 120 kilometers and an endurance of more than eight hours. It features an advanced electro-optical system with a laser designator.\nA photo showing an Orlan-30 carrying two FPV quadcopters under its wings somewhere over the special military operation zone in Ukraine surfaced online on August 22. The photo was likely taken from the video feed of a Ukrainian FPV interceptor drone that was chasing the Orlan-30.\nRead more \nHERE",

      "original": "In Video: Russian Special Forces Raid Ukrainian Fortified Post\nRare video footage showing a raid by Russian special forces on a fortified position of the Ukrainian military in the special military operation zone surfaced online on August 21.\nIt is unclear where exactly the raid took place. Information on such special operations are scarce, and while they are conducted by different Spetsnaz [Russian for special forces] units of the Russian military on a regular basis, they are usually kept under tight wraps.\nThe footage suggests that the night-time raid was carried out by a small squad, all equipped with night vision goggles and silenced assault rifles.\nThe special forces operators took out a few Ukrainian troops who were outside the position, before storming it. They are later seen in the footage clearing nearby trenches and a small underground bunker. Most of the position‚Äôs garrison were killed. Only the few who decided to surrender survived the raid.\nRead more \nHERE",

However, the deployment of the system was not acknowledged by Russia or North Korea until now.\nThe system is typically mounted on the M-2010 6√ó6 wheeled armored vehicle, or a special military mini truck. However, the footage aired by Korean Central Television revealed that a version of the system based on a regular pickup truck was deployed in Kursk.\nIn footage, a missile fired from the system is seen shattering what appears to be a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle of Kiev forces.\nRead more \nHERE",

He noted that such cases point to a growing awareness among AFU servicemen of the dire situation on the front and the futility of further combat operations. The source emphasized that many Ukrainian soldiers are unwilling to sacrifice their lives under conditions where the outcome of the conflict is seen as virtually predetermined.",
