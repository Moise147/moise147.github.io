      "original": "Internal Fracture: How Desertion Is Weakening The Ukrainian Army\nIn December 2025, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office ceased publishing official statistics on desertion and unauthorized abandonment of a military unit (AWOL), citing national security interests. This move became a stark indicator of the systemic crisis engulfing the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), where the number of servicemen leaving service has for several months exceeded the number of arriving mobilized personnel. \nMore than 300,000 cases of unauthorized abandonment and desertion have been recorded since 2022. However, according to estimates by several Ukrainian MPs and experts, the real picture is much bleaker. Verkhovna Rada MP Anna Skorokhod, for example, claimed that by the end of summer 2025, the real number of deserters had approached 400,000, meaning it could exceed half a million by the end of the year.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
