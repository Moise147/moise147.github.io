As they moved further west towards the road, the concentration of FAB bombardment shifted over the Kazenyi Torets River to the Toretske River. After several days of fighting and consolidation, Russian forces were able to secure a small section of the main road leading into Ukraine's Shakhove salient, significantly constricting supplies into the area. Attempts are now underway to expand their zone of control to the adjacent forested areas in the grey-zone and consolidate further.\nFurther south, under heavy air and artillery cover, Russian forces began developing a second axis of attack towards the village of Shakhove. They advanced from their recently re-secured positions northwest of Poltavka, pushing through the treelines on the tactical heights, and forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal towards the eastern approaches to Shakhove. Russia has been heavily bombing the Ukrainian strongpoints in the forested gulley east of Sofiivka, where clearing operations are now ongoing. \n + ~10.40 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
