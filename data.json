This, combined with poor Ukrainian coordination, incompetent commanders, disorganisation, and catastrophic levels of manpower shortages, resulted in the Ukrainians being completely unable to carry out any form of containment operations, despite more than two new brigades being redeployed here.\nThere were two main assault vectors that Russian soldiers took. The first, and most significant, was west of the Velyka Balka Gulley, where they penetrated to Zolotyi Kolodyaz and entrenched in the southern street of the village. Other forces turned west, crossing the Hruzka River and bypassed the village. They moved northwest and uphill along two separate gulleys and managed to physically cut the Dobropillya - Kramatorsk Highway at two points\nThe second attack vector was east of the Velyka Balka Gulley, where Russian forces captured three quarries, and bypassed the village of Kucheriv Yar from the east, moving north along the treelines on the tactical heights towards the villages of Vesele and Hruzke, which both lie on the banks of the Hruzka River. Once they reached the southern bank of the river, the Russians crossed it and establishd control over around half of Vesele, where they are accumulating reinforcements for further attacks. Other forces moved down from the heights and into Kucheriv Yar (which was largely empty), occupying it with little resistance. \nAs for DRGs, they have begun to turn west, infiltrating through the fields around Rubizhne, Stepy, Novyi Donbas, Vilne, Novovodyane, Vesele Pole, and Nove Shakhove, where they entered the cities of Dobropillya, and Bilozerske. Dobropillya is seeing more DRG activity than Bilozerske as Russian forces don't have to go as far through the wedge to reach the city. \nMeanwhile, further south, Russian forces continued to clear positions northeast of Bilytske. They re-established control over the forest west of Nykanorivka, and advanced along the treeline to northern Dorozhnje. They also made further progress in the treelines south of Nove Shakhove. \n+ ~48.31km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
