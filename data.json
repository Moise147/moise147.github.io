      "original": "(PART 2) \nAnalysis on the situation in the Kostyantynivka direction and Russian plans to take the city\n:\nAlthough, it is possible that the Russians will be able to at least secure the forested gulley southwest of Illinivka first, and use this in the future for additional attempts to capture the village\nAs for the right flank of the 72nd Regiment, no major increases in Russian attacks have been observed. Currently, the main vector of attack is along the highway from Stupochky to the large forests east of Kostyantynivka, however no significant success has been recorded yet. Recently, the Russian command redeployed the 70th Motor Rifle Division to the Kostyantynivka direction. In my opinion, this is being done in an attempt to solve the problem on the right flank of the city, in coordination with the recent attacks on Illinivka. Prior to this redeployment, the 28th Motor Rifle Regiment of the 70th Division was already operating in Chasiv Yar, where they have faced problems from Ukrainian incursions into the southwestern part of the city in October (which they have only managed to recapture around half of) and the strong defences in the neighbouring village of Mykolaivka. It's highly likely that the rest of the 70th Division has been redeployed to Bakhmut, where the 24th and 26th Motor Rifle Regiments, along with the 17th Tank Regiment will again attempt to properly develop the right flank of the city.  \nHowever, as these preparations take place, actions are already underway on the extreme right flank of the city in the area of Virolyubivka and Mykolaivka. Here, the 126th and 127th Motor Rifle Regiments have been making incremental progress over the last 3 months, successfully creating a large \"ledge\" northeast of Kostyantynivka. This will likely serve as a springboard for attacks on the Stinky - Klynove line, with the goal of enveloping the strong Ukrainian defences in the area of Mykolaivka, Chervone, and Podilske, which would eventually collapse remaining Ukrainian defences northeast of the city. \nOverall, the Russian command appears to be implementing a comprehensive plan to take Kostyantynivka (Whose pre-war population exceeds that of Pokrovsk) in a timely manner. If this succeeds, it will prevent Russian forces from engaging in an extremely prolonged and costly battle for this large city, and allow them to coordinate properly with adjacent offensives in the directions of Dobropillya and Slovyansk.",

Other forces levelled the frontline in the treelines to the south and began pushing further west in the direction of Markove.\nTo the southwest, Russian forces continued advancing in the direction of Fedorivka, where they managed to consolidate in new positions in the forested parts of the gulley. They also improved their positions in the treeline to the west.\nTo the south, at some point recently, Russian forces consolidated in the southeastern part of Virolyubivka, on the southern bank of the tributary of the Bilenka River. Ukrainian forces subsequently carried out several counterattacks to dislodge these Russian soldiers, but they were ultimately repelled.\nTo the southeast, Russian forces continued incrementally advancing west of Chasiv Yar.

Other assault groups continued expanding their zone of control to the northwest, where they managed to capture new positions in two different treelines. \n+ ~5.68 km² in favour of Russia. \nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",
