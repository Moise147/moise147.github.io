Ukraine often launches hundreds at a time just for a couple to get through. \nThe drones that do get through (usually only 1 or 2 each day), and that hit refineries do minor damage as evidenced by footage and satellite imagery, due to how refineries are built, and the drones' small warheads. \nThe damage done is then repaired within months due to how robust refineries are. This leads to only a temporary loss. \nMeanwhile, the figures on Russian refining capabilities always get skewed to show total amount per refinery (per year), and not what is actually lost... which is only part of the refining capabilities for part of a year.\nAt the same time, everyone seems to be ignoring the hundreds of Russian Geran-2 drone STRIKES (not launches, strikes) per week that are hitting targets of military significance and contributing massively to the overall war of attrition.\nBut don't worry... just 50 more days and Russia will collapse.",
