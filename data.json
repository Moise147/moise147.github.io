There were no casualties among Israeli soldiers.\nAfter a brief pause in their operations in the Tubas Governorate of the West Bank, the IDF has recently resumed attempts to eliminate individual cells from the Tubas Battalion and disrupt their attempts to re-establish their full presence in the area following the Israeli and Palestinian Authority operations from late 2024.",

They state that crew survived and was evacuated by an Mi-8 helicopter.\nThis suggests that the distant explosion heard from Zaporizhzhia city at around 4:05 am was unrelated to this aircraft. While there was an air raid alert in place for all of Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Oblast at the time, no tactical aircraft activity or launch maneuvers were reported.\nKeep in mind, launch maneuvers can be missed, and a declared target can be misidentified if the glide-bombs are targeting something \"in front\" of it (e.g. hitting Lyman instead of Slovyansk). If the Su-34 was shot down, the Ukrainian Airforce could be stating that it was targeting Zaporizhzhia City for informational effect due to the intensity of attacks on the city over the past 5 days.",
