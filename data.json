      "original": "In the Pokrovsk direction, over the past week Russian forces have continued to expand their zone of control inside the city and have made significant progress towards the city centre.\nRussian forces advanced in two areas. In the north, they completed the capture of the southwestern streets of the city and crossed the E-50 Highway to the market district. They were able to rapidly capture the city central markets, reaching the city centre from the west. They also advanced southeast down the highway to the edge of the Shakhtarskyi District, and reached Yuvileynyy Park from the north. Additionally, the Russians completed the capture of the village of Troyanda, which was previously partially in the grey zone. \nIn the south, Russian forces advanced further east through the Kalynivka District, capturing additional positions in the low-rise residential buildings and the nearby dachas. They were also able to enter the southwestern part of the Lazurnyi District, establishing control over several high-rise buildings. \nThe main goal for Russia in Pokrovsk seems to be to reach the railway station in the northeastern part of the city. In the area of the railway station - north of the railway tracks - is a heavily fortified industrial area, which contains a network of bunkers and coal tunnels which stretch out to the rest of Pokrovsk. It is believed to be one of the largest underground tunnel systems in all of Europe. \n+ ~2.00 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
