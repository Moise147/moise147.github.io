They entered the treelines on its northwestern approaches, which were used to infiltrate the village, which is now in the grey zone. The Russians were also able to capture the treelines northeast of Varachyne. \nMeanwhile, Ukrainian forces continued their assault operations towards Oleksiivka, and have managed to consolidate in the agricultural buildings on its western outskirts. Attempts are now underway to enter the residential part of the village from the west. These attacks are being carried out under heavy FPV drone and artillery cover, which is resulting in heavy casualties for the Russian garrison in Oleksiivka, but due to the road being open for limited ground movement again, rotations can now be carried out to some extent.

At the same time, all of this was done primarily to impress the West and secure their financial support.\nThe nation's military was not an exception to this. Large territorial units of troops, known in the Soviet Union as 'military districts', were renamed 'operational commands' and given names based on the four main directions: 'North' (Chernihiv), 'West' (Rivne), 'South' (Odesa) and 'East' (Dnipro). \nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
