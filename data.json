In turn, Russian air defense systems, as stated by the Russian Defense Ministry, destroyed 164 Ukrainian UAVs over the course of the night.\nUkrainian aviation expert Valeriy Romanenko highlighted a significant increase in Russia's use of ballistic missiles. He stated that 101 such missiles were launched at Ukraine in October, which is approximately five times the figure from the previous month, when 21 launches were recorded. Romanenko links this intensification to Ukraine's acute shortage of modern air defense systems, such as Patriots, which reduces interception capabilities.

The testimonies of captured soldiers from the 14th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Yuriy Shapovalenko and Alexey Vinder, paint a picture of the critical situation facing the surrounded formations.\n\"We surrendered ourselves. About four days after we were brought here, we realized we were surrounded by the Russians. Resupply was gone – no ammunition, our water ran out, very little food was left. We ate one can of stew among three men per day. The route across the Oskol River was already cut off – it's all your FPV drones there. Because of that, there was no logistics left. A lot of your soldiers entered the city. So, we decided to come out with a white rag,\" recounted prisoner of war Shapovalenko.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
