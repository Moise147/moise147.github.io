The violence began at the ancient, disputed Ta Muen Thom temple site in the Thai province of Surin, which was claimed by Cambodia, before spreading out to other border areas.\nThe situation escalated after the Cambodian military fired Grad 122 mm rockets at a gas station in the town of Ban Phue in the Thai province of Sisaket.
