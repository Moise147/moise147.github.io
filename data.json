      "original": "I think one thing that a lot of people underestimate is how many civilians remain in the Pokrovsk area. Pokrovsk alone has thousands of residents still holding out, while Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's residents combined also number in the thousands. I'd estimate over 5,000 in total remain across the 4 settlements. \nThe last shops and convenience stores closed in Rodynske last week, giving away all of their stock to civilians, but only after the Russians broke through towards the city's eastern outskirts. As of roughly two months ago, a few local shops in Pokrovsk City Centre were still selling basic supplies including food, water, antibiotics, and other medicines, although it's possible that these have since finally closed considering the deteriorating situation on the flanks and intensified Russian bombardment. \nOn average, 1 civilian in Pokrovsk is killed daily from the Russian artillery, MLRS, drone and FAB bombardment. This is despite its population still numbering in the thousands, its proximity to the frontline, the heavy Ukrainian presence in the city, and its strategic importance to the Russians.\nPokrovsk - as far as I know - was more Anti-Russia than most cities in the Donbas, especially Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut and Donetsk City. Nevertheless, people choose to stay behind, usually because they are waiting for \"liberation\" or because they have grown up there and lived in the city for their whole lives. It's all they have ever known, so it makes it more difficult to leave to cities further west. \nAdditionally, many residents who were evacuated from cities such as Avdiivka moved to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, yet less than a year later these cities were practically on the frontlines and under heavy Russian bombardment. Many people, especially elderly, do not want to have to go through the struggle or uprooting their lives and relocating once, let alone twice within a year. \nToday, a large portion of Pokrovsk, Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Hryshyne's populations are elderly, although many are middle-aged or younger. Most men between the ages of 18 and 60 either escaped or were mobilised. Localised mobilisation efforts were still ongoing in Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad up until 1-2 weeks ago, which had previously been ramped up when extra police and TCC units from other regions were sent to bolster Donetsk's police and TCC force, although I expect these efforts have since halted considering recent events.",

There are ways to get extremely specific intel through OSINT and insider information. You have to remember, this war has been ongoing for over 3 years, and Russian air tactics remain largely the same. This allows for significant development in knowledge and ability to produce reliable reports as you don't have to account for many other variables. I will probably make a post on this in the near future outlining some channels and how I personally think they gather their data.",

FABs also targeted almost every part of the village held by the AFU, causing significant casualties among their forces and slowing their advance. \nRussian FAB glide-bombs then struck the bridge between the two reservoirs, connecting the centre to the eastern part of the village, to complicate further Ukrainian movement west. The remaining Russian soldiers were then withdrawn from the village centre. \nDespite this extensive bombardment, Ukrainian soldiers managed to cross the tributary and establish positions in a few houses in the northwest of the village. The Russians tried to cut off the Ukrainians in the northwest by attacking to the northern street from the area of the reservoirs but were forced to retreat back after encountering heavy resistance, indicating further Ukrainian reinforcements have been getting brought in. \nAt the same time, Ukrainian forces had to withdraw from the gulley west of Kindrativka back to the treeline to the south, after being hit by over a dozen FABs and failing to consolidate. It's likely that this was a diversionary attack for the main operation on Kindrativka from the west, tying up Russian forces and complicating their movement in and out of the village.\n+ ~4.95km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

Using Yablunivka as the main staging ground, Russian forces cleared the rest of the forest and seized the forest plantations on the eastern bank. \nFrom there, they crossed the bridge at the Novomykolaivka - Yablunivka road, establishing control over the forest and pushing up the adjacent treeline. Other forces then crossed the fields to Varachyne, where fierce battles ensued for the eastern houses. Russian forces exploited Ukraine's weakened forward position northwest of Varachyne and was able to push from Novomykolaivka to the intersection of three treelines, applying additional pressure on the Ukrainian soldiers in Varachyne. \nEventually Russian soldiers captured the village, and established full control over the treelines to the north.

They advanced east along the railway line, utilising the cover from the windbreaks on either side of the tracks to infiltrate Russian trench positions and dugouts, recapturing them and reaching the main trench strongpoints at the bridge. \nOnce this strongpoint was under Ukrainian control, and positions had been recaptured in the adjacent forest, small groups of Ukrainian soldiers moved east across the open fields and infiltrated the southeastern part of Stepova Novosilka at two points. \nMeanwhile, Russian soldiers slightly improved their positions to the north, crossing a gulley and establishing control over a small treeline to the west. \n+ ~2.28km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.33km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

In the northeast, they captured positions in two treeline in Luhansk Oblast, and completed the capture of the forest in Donetsk Oblast, forcing a Ukrainian withdrawal back to the Kharkiv side of the Kharkiv-Donetsk-Luhansk tri-border intersection.\nTo the southwest, Russian forces improved their positions north of Ridkodub, advancing down two treelines and capturing a third. They also entered the northern edge of the agricultural complex on the northern outskirts of Ridkodub, but it is unclear if they were able to recapture any positions there.\nUkrainian forces advanced in two areas. In the east, they continued to advance east through the village of Ridkodub and recaptured the local administrative building, as well as further houses on Tsentralna Street. They also re-entered the northeastern street of the village, capturing the western end of it. Russian forces no longer maintain a significant presence in Ridkodub, and mainly cover it with drones and artillery while holding a foothold in the eastern houses. \nIn the west, Ukrainian forces eliminated the Russian bridgehead on the western bank of the Nitrius River in Karpivka, and crossed over at the same point between the reservoirs. They were able to establish their own bridgehead on the eastern bank of the river, and advanced northeast, pushing Russian soldiers out of the northern part of the village. Despite this progress, their presence in the northern houses isn't significant enough to safely move across the other bridge between the reservoirs, despite it being under their control.\n+ ~2.32km¬≤ in favour of Russia.\n+ ~2.08km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",
