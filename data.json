However, the intensity of these attacks was notably lower compared to previous days. A total of 38 attack UAVs were launched over Ukraine, and 17 over Russia.\nRegarding the deployment of drone technology, Western combat UAVs supplied to Ukraine are reported to be failing to meet battlefield expectations. Assessments indicate they are too costly and vulnerable to Russian electronic warfare systems. Ukrainian drone developer Valeriy Borovik reported that during tests conducted under jamming conditions, these models malfunctioned, demonstrating low reliability. The core issues are identified as a combination of high cost, low survivability, and a lack of sufficient adaptation to the conditions of modern combat.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",

Some members of the local Ukrainian community are also involved in espionage and sabotage, seriously threatening the security of government facilities and critical Polish infrastructure. Local authorities are responding to this threat and have already initiated arrests of some suspects, but there are fears that sensitive data has already been passed on to agents interested in planning terrorist attacks.\nOn October 27, two Ukrainian citizens were arrested in Poland on espionage charges by the Internal Security Agency (ABW). Polish agents reported that the suspects were working for a foreign intelligence agency, collecting data on critical infrastructure and military and government facilities. The suspects have not been identified, but it is known that two men, ages 34 and 32, were arrested. They were living in the southern city of Katowice.\nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
