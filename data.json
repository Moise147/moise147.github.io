At the same time, all of this was done primarily to impress the West and secure their financial support.\nThe nation's military was not an exception to this. Large territorial units of troops, known in the Soviet Union as 'military districts', were renamed 'operational commands' and given names based on the four main directions: 'North' (Chernihiv), 'West' (Rivne), 'South' (Odesa) and 'East' (Dnipro). \nüëâ\n Read more \nHERE",
