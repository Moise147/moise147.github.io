The Ukrainian 119th Territorial Defense Brigade withdrew to the large forests further west.\nShortly afterwards, Russian forces crossed the border at multiple points further south and entered the village of Hrabovske. Street fighting ensued; however, the Russians were able to bring in considerable amounts of infantry, forcing the Ukrainians to leave. 56 civilians resided there at the time, around 6 of which were evacuated by Ukrainian forces. The rest refused to leave. Russian soldiers evacuated the remaining 50 civilians, all of which are adults who signed waivers of evacuation, to Belgorod Oblast, while assault groups continued their attacks.\nAfter occupying both Hrabovske and Vysoke, Russian forces secured the forests between them, which had a minimal Ukrainian presence due to their proximity to the border. \nHowever, the main push was made further west from Hrabovske to the nearby village of Ryasne. Russian forces managed to penetrate west and capture parts of the forests there. Forward units have already entered the eastern part of Ryasne where fighting is now ongoing. 9 civilians have been evacuated by Ryasne by Ukrainian forces so far.\nThe Ukrainian defence here is held by a unit (119th brigade) which was recently pulled from the Serebryanskyi Forest in Luhansk Oblast to here, as this sector was a much quieter part of the frontline, meaning their combat capabilities are at least somewhat degraded. Currently, most defensive actions are being carried out by FPV drone operators, who are attempting to slow the Russian advance for the time being. \n+ ~13.40 km² in favour of Russia. \nInteractive map link: \nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?hl=en&mid=1thW9kqnDOaS2lAepLhLdzSX8Ur9Sc4k&ll",

In the 1960s, the Army sought a vehicle capable of keeping pace with main battle tanks, protecting infantry against nuclear, chemical, and conventional threats, while also delivering effective firepower. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

This move became a stark indicator of the systemic crisis engulfing the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), where the number of servicemen leaving service has for several months exceeded the number of arriving mobilized personnel. \nMore than 300,000 cases of unauthorized abandonment and desertion have been recorded since 2022. However, according to estimates by several Ukrainian MPs and experts, the real picture is much bleaker. Verkhovna Rada MP Anna Skorokhod, for example, claimed that by the end of summer 2025, the real number of deserters had approached 400,000, meaning it could exceed half a million by the end of the year.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
