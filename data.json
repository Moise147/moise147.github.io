After the last section of the Siversky Donets line fell, Russian forces began focusing on capturing positions outside the large, fortified forest southeast of Stupochky, and then storming it. Neither of these goals were achieved. \nAfter their successful defence in the forest, Ukrainian forces then attempted a series of counterattacks towards the highway northwest of Predtechyne, but were unsuccessful. However, this did tie up Russian forces in the area and eventually led to the Russians attempting to advance towards the eastern dachas of Kostyantynivka. Nevertheless, Ukrainian forces were able to consolidate in the forest north of the highway and began advancing towards Predtechyne. They secured isolated positions west of the village, before entering it and taking up positions in the western houses.

Ukrainian forces, utilising the trench fortifications in the forest to the north were able to hold the northern part of the settlement, and launched a few counterattacks, however these were repelled. Russian forces responded by dropping several FAB glide-bombs on this forest. \nTo the east, Ukrainian forces continued their slow advance towards Dachne.
