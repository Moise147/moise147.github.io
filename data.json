Now there are 2 Tu-95MS at Engels-2, and none at Olenya. \nAt least 3 Kalibr carriers stationed at Novorossiysk Naval Base, Krasnodar Krai are equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, including one 11356R ‚ÄúAdmiral Makarov‚Äù frigate, one 11356R ‚ÄúAdmiral Essen‚Äù Frigate, and one Buyan-M corvette. \nNo new deliveries of Iskander-M ballistic or Iskander-K cruise missiles to OTRK installations surrounding Ukraine have taken place over the past three days, however there are still missiles there which are available for launch, meaning that individual strikes on newly discovered targets are likely over the next 48 hours.\n1 An-26 cargo plane landed at Shaykovka Airbase, Kaluga Oblast. The cargo consists of Kh-22 cruise missiles for the 7 Tu-22m3 strategic bombers currently stationed there. Some of these bombers may take part in the next large strike.\n2 Tu-22m3 bombers remain stationed at Olenya Airbase. They carried out a training mission as a part of Russia's nuclear exercises. Both bombers are equipped with missiles and carried out simulated launches (likely with electronic warfare) from over the Barents Sea yesterday. \nAccumulation of Geran-2/Gebera drones continues at other launch points in preparation for their usage both in the next large-scale attack, and smaller attacks prior to that. \n5 Tu-95MS remain stationed at Diaghilev Airbase, Ryazan Oblast. They are not expected to take part in the next large-scale attack. \n3 Tu-160s are stationed at Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast. At least 1 is equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles. 4 other Tu-160s are stationed at Ukrainka Airbase, but their status is currently unknown. \nSu-34R and Su-24MR aircraft continue to carry out intensified reconnaissance operations, especially over Rostov Oblast and Krasnodar Krai. \nNo A-50U AWACS aircraft flights were recorded yesterday or today, despite their recent flight activity from Ulyanovsk-East Airbase. \n5 MiG-31Ks redeployed from Savasleika Airbase, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, to Akhtubinsk Airbase, Astrakhan Oblast. It is from there that they launched Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles during yesterday's missile attack. 6 MiG-31Ks are currently stationed at Akhtubinsk, while none are at Savasleika.
