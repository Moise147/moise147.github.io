They made further progress in the forest northwest of the town, before Russian soldiers on motorbikes advanced down the road from Shandryholove, and entered the town. Positions were captured in the outermost buildings, and fighting is ongoing in the grey-zone further south. Additionally, Russian forces continued attacking from the Derylove area, where they were able to capture positions in three separate treelines on the tactical heights overlooking Drobysheve. Fighting is now underway for the agricultural buildings on the outskirts of the town. \nFurther west, Russian forces were able to cross the Nitrius River from the Drobysheve Fish Farm into Novoselivka. They established a foothold in the houses on Tsentralna Street and Ukrayinska Street, before pushing northwest towards the western part of the village. Other forces advanced north towards the centre of the village where they are attempting to squeeze the Ukrainians out from multiple directions. Heavy fighting continues here.\nTo the north, Russian forces managed to break through Ukrainian positions in the forests northwest of Novoselivka under heavy FAB, artillery, and drone cover, establishing control over additional positions there. They then went on to advance south, cutting the  Novoselivka - Oleksandrivka road at the graveyard, while capturing further forested positions down the road to the northwest. Additionally, Russian FPV drone strikes on Ukrainian logistics and bridges has increased in intensity in this sector, complicating supply to critical parts of the frontline like Novoselivka.\nIn the north, Russian forces advance from their positions west of Shandryholove, into the forested gulley to the west, establishing full control over it.

Russian soldiers holding these areas hadn't properly consolidated, which made clearing them easier for the AFU. With this, Russian supply into Kupyansk is now constricted into a 2.4 km wide corridor.\nMeanwhile, in Kupyansk itself, the Russians continued to advance.

      "original": "Some are upset by yesterday's images in Moscow, but the reality is what it is. Russia intervened to help the former Syrian government fight terrorists and secure its position in the eastern Mediterranean. Between 2015 and 2020, the government regained more than half of the country, and it seemed that the Syrian state would prevail.\nHowever, Russia's entry into the Syrian civil war also involved a series of decisions and reforms that the previous political regime in Damascus was unwilling to allow, so relations between Russia and Syria were not always cordial, despite what was intended to be shown. These relations began to deteriorate in 2024, with the worsening standard of living, rampant corruption, and the stagnation of the political regime. The start of the ‚ÄúSpecial Military Operation‚Äù in Ukraine in 2022 deprived Syria of Russian support to maintain military operations in the country. With its hands tied by Ukraine and unable to focus on another front, it is clear that Moscow sought an agreed exit for Al-Assad with Turkey to allow Jolani to come to power, and with Iran, whose power in the region had been diminished after setbacks in Lebanon and the bloodshed in Syria. Iran maintained good relations with Syria until the costs outweighed the benefits, prompting a withdrawal of its support to neighboring Iraq.\nIsrael did not participate in that agreement (Astana), but it did contribute until December 2024 to the fall of the previous Syrian political regime by attacking the allies of the resistance axis and supporting terrorist groups. After that, it has a free hand to occupy the rest of Quneitra and de facto control the demilitarized south of Syria.\nFor those who claim that the SAA had no will to fight and that Russia was not obliged to defend them, it should be noted that before November, the situation was irreversible with or without Russian help. The SAA commanders were either bribed or aware of the betrayal, abandoned their posts, and went into exile (specifically Suhayl al-Hasan and Ghiath Dalla) while the soldiers fought on the front lines. On the terrorist side, the commanders knew the plans, while the rank-and-file militants believed in a limited offensive.\nIn those days, Russia saved its image by eliminating more than a thousand terrorists with the limited air power it had, knowing in advance that it would not change the agreed situation and the end of the previous government.\nFinally, playing devil's advocate, the fall of al-Assad allows Russia to more easily influence a weakened Syria that is more likely to reach agreements due to the new authorities' desperation to consolidate their power. However, pragmatism prevails over Moscow's preferences, which would prefer a secular government to an Islamist one in Syria. (Although more flexible than the previous one), so just as Al-Assad was betrayed, Jolani will also be betrayed when the agreements are not respected and Russia has freed itself from the war in Ukraine. But what is clear is that Russia will not abandon the eastern Mediterranean.",

      "original": "This is all part of the west's greater geopolitical strategy. They don't want to fight Russia directly, so they engage them through a proxy (Ukraine). This frees up other areas which they can focus on, such as China. \nIts also part of the reason why Israel will always receive massive amounts of support - they operate in American interests (at least on the theatre-level) and will expand control over Syria and the West Bank. With Assad gone, Hezbollah's main supply routes from Iran are no longer usable to the same degree, and they can now successfully be starved with the help of the new Lebanese government. \nMinority groups in southern Syria, especially the Druze, will always choose Israel over Jolani, further increasing Israeli and American influence in the region, and preventing Iran from building any form of proxy here. \nIt's all part of a larger plan by the west to dismantle opposing states that endanger their dying hegemony indirectly and silently, engaging with those who will do their bidding, but only as long as its worth it for them. Ukraine is a perfect example of this. \nGone are the times of publicly invading and overthrowing regimes, and promoting hegemony and modern imperialism. That isn't worth it, instead its easier and more convenient to go about things more quietly. The U.S. political system allows this as both parties have the same foreign policy goals in mind. They are able to keep America strong and stable on the inside, allowing for them to continue what they do best on the outside. \nGlobalisation is one of the reasons why it has to be done this way. One of America's biggest weaknesses is having to deal with everyone all at once. Their decline has meant they can only focus in on specific goals directly, which is why they need proxies. And that's without considering what could happen if people in the U.S. actually woke up and used their brains for once to look at the bigger picture - not just which party tells them they are right.\nOf course, this isn't considering what Russia and China want. They too have the same selfish goals in mind, as with any great power throughout history. But the difference is that multipolarity currently favours China and Russia, while America requires unipolarity at this point.",
