Well, it turns out that these were probably mixed up with S-300/400 air defence missiles targeting Ukrainian cruise missiles which were coincidentally attacking Belgorod at this exact time. Like I said, this is a pure coincidence, but it made many people in Kharkiv think that missiles were flying in their direction.\nAnother supporting point for this is that three aerial targets were detected flying towards Kharkiv at the time, whereas only two explosions took place in the city. From what I understand, two of these Russian air defence missiles targeted the Ukrainian cruise missiles, while the third targeted Ukrainian fighter jets over the city of Chuhuiv. \nAs a result of these explosions in Kharkiv, at least 2 civilians were killed, including a 3-year-old and his mother, and another 28 were wounded. \nCoordinates: 50.012172, 36.243989",
