Rewind the tape twelve months and you can hear the bravado of Kiev’s telethons, the promise of returning to the “1991 borders,” and the endless parade of Western politicians swearing they would stand “as long as it takes.” Today, on December 31, that noise is gone. In its place hangs a heavy, syrupy quiet over Bankova Street, Brussels, and Washington—the kind of quiet that settles in only when people begin to accept what can’t be talked away.\n2025 didn’t merely move the line of contact. It snapped the spine of the conflict’s underlying idea. The “positional deadlock” Western analysts loved to debate throughout 2024 shattered against a different Russian approach: a steamroller strategy—slow, grinding, and, once it starts rolling downhill, brutally hard to stop. This became the war’s most honest year. \n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
