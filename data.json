FABs also targeted almost every part of the village held by the AFU, causing significant casualties among their forces and slowing their advance. \nRussian FAB glide-bombs then struck the bridge between the two reservoirs, connecting the centre to the eastern part of the village, to complicate further Ukrainian movement west. The remaining Russian soldiers were then withdrawn from the village centre. \nDespite this extensive bombardment, Ukrainian soldiers managed to cross the tributary and establish positions in a few houses in the northwest of the village. The Russians tried to cut off the Ukrainians in the northwest by attacking to the northern street from the area of the reservoirs but were forced to retreat back after encountering heavy resistance, indicating further Ukrainian reinforcements have been getting brought in. \nAt the same time, Ukrainian forces had to withdraw from the gulley west of Kindrativka back to the treeline to the south, after being hit by over a dozen FABs and failing to consolidate. It's likely that this was a diversionary attack for the main operation on Kindrativka from the west, tying up Russian forces and complicating their movement in and out of the village.\n+ ~4.95km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.",

Other forces then crossed the fields to Varachyne, where fierce battles ensued for the eastern houses. Russian forces exploited Ukraine's weakened forward position northwest of Varachyne and was able to push from Novomykolaivka to the intersection of three treelines, applying additional pressure on the Ukrainian soldiers in Varachyne. \nEventually Russian soldiers captured the village, and established full control over the treelines to the north.

They advanced east along the railway line, utilising the cover from the windbreaks on either side of the tracks to infiltrate Russian trench positions and dugouts, recapturing them and reaching the main trench strongpoints at the bridge. \nOnce this strongpoint was under Ukrainian control, and positions had been recaptured in the adjacent forest, small groups of Ukrainian soldiers moved east across the open fields and infiltrated the southeastern part of Stepova Novosilka at two points. \nMeanwhile, Russian soldiers slightly improved their positions to the north, crossing a gulley and establishing control over a small treeline to the west. \n+ ~2.28km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~0.33km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",
