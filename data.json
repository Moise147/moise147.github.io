With its help, military personnel identify enemy firing positions in seconds and give their artillery target indications for return fire. As a result, the barrel of the enemy cannon does not have time to cool down after firing, while a response is already coming from our side,\" the source said.\nThe Penicillin was developed to detect and locate artillery, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, anti-aircraft or tactical-missile firing positions with seismic and acoustic sensors.\nRead more: \nHERE",

A recent article¬†published¬†by Le Monde revealed that there is ample evidence that military casualties in Ukraine are much higher than official figures indicate, given the growing demand for cemetery space for new burials.\nAccording to Le Monde, all cemetery areas in Ukraine reserved for soldiers are already fully occupied. The overload is forcing authorities to use common cemetery space, which is normally reserved for civilians, as well as to establish various projects to expand current cemeteries and create new ones. The demand for burial space is enormous as more and more dead bodies arrive from the front lines.\n‚ÄúAcross the country, teams of architects have been working on memorials that reflect not only the scale of the ongoing carnage but also the evolving ideas about national identity,‚Äù the article reads.\nüëâ\nRead More\n \nHERE",
