Two of them, each equipped with 2 Kh-32 cruise missiles, redeployed from Belaya Airbase, Irkutsk Oblast, to Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast. 2 other Tu-22m3 bombers stationed at Engels-2 Airbase are also equipped with 1 Kh-32 missile each. \nIt’s also likely that two Buyan-M corvettes were equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles at Kaspiysk Naval Base, Republic of Dagestan, in the Caspian Sea. They can launch a maximum of 16 Kalibrs. \nHowever, 2 days ago, 1 Tu-160 and 1 Tu-95MS strategic bomber redeployed from Engels-2 Airbase to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast. There, they will likely be equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles.\nRemember, another 4 Tu-95MS are already equipped with missiles at Olenya Airbase, Murmansk Oblast, ready for use. \nAs for Iskanders, deliveries of Iskander-M ballistic missiles and possibly Iskander-K cruise missiles were carried out to OTRK installations in Voronezh and Rostov Oblast.\nMass accumulation of Geran-2 and Gerbera drones continues at all major launch sites surrounding Ukraine.",
