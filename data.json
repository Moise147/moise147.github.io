Russian forces then launched a series of counterattacks and cleared these buildings, before beginning a push down the road to Andriivka. At the same time, Ukrainian forces continued attempts at entering and entrenching in the eastern part of Oleksiivka.\nTo the east, multiple Russian assault groups used an underground pipeline to attack Ukrainian positions to the rear of Varachyne. Ukrainian formations stationed in the area were aware of this pipe and immediately fired on Russian soldiers emerging from it. Nevertheless, the numbers of Russian soldiers who emerged were too high for the Ukrainians to contain, forcing them to withdraw from the area. The surviving Russian soldiers established control over some treeline positions, and Ukrainian drones are trying to pick them off. Two attempts at reconnecting with other forces to the northwest failed with casualties. \nMeanwhile, due to the complicated situation for Ukraine and the disruption of their supply routes, Russia was able to enter the northern part of Varachyne relatively unopposed and consolidate in the houses there. Attempts are now underway to establish control over the rest of the village. Other forces advanced west of Varachyne, capturing new treeline positions on the tactical heights. \nIn the east, following earlier unsucessful attacks and consolidation attempts, Russian forces resumed assault operations in the village of Yunakivka and recaptured positions in the southern part of the village.
