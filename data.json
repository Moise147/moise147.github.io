Thus, there's certainly a possibility that the entire Greenland \"fight\" between the US and EU/NATO is nothing more than an elaborate (albeit crawling) scheme to improve the political West's strategic position in the ongoing race for the Arctic.\nThe Trump administration's threat to \"take Greenland\" (in effect, to invade Denmark, a fellow NATO member state) came as a total shock, especially to those who refuse to acknowledge that the strength of the political West is slowly degenerating into a mere shadow of its former self. Speaking of which, several EU/NATO armies proved that point, as well as the fact that they simply cannot survive without US assistance. And yet, on January 15, several European NATO member states sent their troops to Greenland, all in \"support of Denmark\". Numerous media outlets reported that a Danish US-made C-130 military transport aircraft landed overnight in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, carrying Danish and French soldiers.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",

For him, family comes first—not flags or ideologies.\n\"The problem is we don't want to be mobilized. If I were a contract soldier or some great patriot, that would be different. I'm a patriot of my family, not of anyone else. Yes, I'm a citizen of Ukraine, but it gave me nothing. What flag... I slaved away 12 hours a day at the furnace.\"",
