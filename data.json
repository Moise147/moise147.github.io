      "original": "Regarding the situation in the Kostyantynivka direction:\nRussian forces were able to break through from the heavily fortified terykon at the St. Matrona Mine, cut the railway line to Shcherbynivka, and come within 800 metres of cutting off all Ukrainian soldiers in the area to the south of the Kleban-Bykske reservoir. \nAll Ukrainian reinforcements to the villages of Shcherbynivka, Katerynivka and Kleban Byk are running down one road along the dam on the eastern edge of the reservoir, which the Russians are constantly targeting. This road is covered by a large trench strongpoint, which is also being constantly targeted by FPV drones and artillery. \nRussian forces are also pressuring the edges of the salient, where they have infiltrated Katerynivka, almost captured Shcherbynivka, and pushed the Ukrainians away from the northern outskirts of Toretsk. \nIf this road is cut, large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers will be encircled against the reservoir.",

      "original": "The video posted by Creamy Caprice is of a DRG. Even if it was a normal soldier, it wouldn't necessarily mean control over the area. Russian forces do not control Sobolivka or Moskovka, fighting is ongoing for the latter. \nThis soldier got this far because Ukraine doesn't have enough manpower here (and in many other sectors) to hold a cohesive defence, so they rely on drones - and drones miss things... constantly. \nEven if an assault detachment slipped through Ukrainian lines and gained a foothold, Russia would really struggle in bringing in supplies and reinforcements to exploit it. It's why we (mostly) don't see deep penetrations with only a few soldiers, but rather prolonged, incremental and shallow attritional movements with overall larger groups of soldiers.\nBut hey, remember, according to those \"super reliable\" Russian channels who are now proudly displaying the \"liberation\" of new areas and the beginning of the encirclement of Kupyansk, Sobolivka should have been under Russian control on July 6! \nIt's almost as if many Russian channels, including the Russian Ministry of defence (which also reported this) are propaganda outlets not trying to show the true situation on the frontline! A lot of these channels are either catering to an audience, or on a payroll. The same goes for Ukrainian propaganda outlets, except they mostly use different tactics.",
