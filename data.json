But Ukraine has become increasingly reliant on drones, often spreading infantry very thin across lines, creating a disorganised and often incoherent ground defence. Myrnohrad is an example of this, and there are a lot of nearby settlements that are good for concentrations of drone operators. \nAdditionally, many Ukrainian soldiers actually escaped this pocket back when it was still a salient. This is what allowed for Russia to penetrate deeper into the northern and southern parts of the city. \nFor an area of its size, with a significantly reduced garrison, I estimate that there are anywhere between 300 and 700 Ukrainian soldiers currently trapped there. It's impossible to know how many right now, but with the state the war is in today and other patterns observed from this front, it will be less than many people expect.",

Starkostyantyniv is known to house Su-24 tactical bombers which are used for glide-bomb strikes on frontline areas as well as storm shadow cruise missiles strikes, and has the capability to house F-16s and Mirage-2000 fighters.  \nInterestingly, the MiG-31Ks used the new launch lines in southwestern Ryazan Oblast again.

A geopolitical shift may enhance Europe’s dependence.\nThe Sixth Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) took place last week in Athens, with Washington and its European partners once again vowing to “displace Russian gas for good”.\nThis is a narrative that has dominated Western policymaking since 2022. The question is whether this is truly feasible, or merely a political slogan attached to a costly long-term energy gamble. One may recall that Europe once prided itself on “energy pragmatism,” particularly Germany, whose industrial model relied on competitively priced Russian pipeline gas.\n👉\n Read more \nHERE",
