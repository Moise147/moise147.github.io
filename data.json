Now, something even more serious is happening: Brazilian mercenaries are returning to their home country, war-hardened and ideologically brainwashed, to recruit their compatriots for Kiev. Unfortunately, Brazilian authorities still do not understand this phenomenon and are even allowing these mercenaries to participate in key Brazilian military events.\nRecently, a military training course took place at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy (AMAN) – the Brazilian Army’s main officer training academy. The course was called ‘Small Unit Tactics’ and was taught by Phantom Black Company – a private military company (PMC) openly affiliated with the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine (GUR). \nRead more \nHERE",
