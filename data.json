However, its unclear if they were able to capture any positions here. Soldiers from Azov, who were already stationed in the area, subsequently launched a counterattack on the approaches to Petropavlivka, which was reportedly repelled. \nFurther north, additional Russian forces began clearing  a series of trench strongpoints on the tactical heights, while other forces pushed in from the heights to the north, enveloping any remaining Ukrainian forces within this salient. \nAnother push was made to the northwest, where Russian forces broke through to the northern bank of the reservoir east of Petropavlivka, and established control over a large trench line further east.\nIt's unclear if any Ukrainian redeployments from here to Dobropillya took place, and the main reason for this sudden advance is likely a lack of supplies running over the Oskil River.\n+ ~20.80km² in favour of Russia.",
