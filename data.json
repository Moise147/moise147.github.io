      "original": "On this day, 2 years ago, one of the world's most heavily armed guerilla armies, alongside several other militant factions, launched an invasion of Israel from the Gaza Strip. Approximately 6,000 rockets were launched in the first week of the war, completely overwhelming one of the world's strongest air defence networks, while hundreds of hostages were taken back into Gaza. Over 1,000 Israelis were killed, in an effort not only targeting the Israeli military, but also as many civilians as possible.\nTwo years later, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians lie dead, in a genocide and ethnic cleansing that is only just beginning to be recognised. Most buildings in the Gaza Strip have either been flattened or are heavily damaged. The health sector continues to operate at a bare minimum due to constant attacks and restraints on aid and fuel. \nHamas and its allied factions are a shadow of their former selves. Incredibly degraded from constant Israeli attacks, most of their original fighters are dead, wounded, or captured, with untrained and young recruits making up the majority of their ranks. \nBut arguably the most significant events that resulted from this surprise attack was the spillover. Israel has since attacked Lebanon, Syria, Iran, the West Bank, and Qatar, resulting in rising tensions across the region, and the beginning of a systematic (and successful) effort at dismantling Iran's \"axis of resistance\", which now lies in ruin. \nOn the other hand, Israel's image on the world stage has changed drastically. 20 new countries have recognised a Palestinian state, while widespread condemnation and global awareness was brought to Israel, and Israel's actions. \nToday, peace negotiations are once again underway, despite failures in all the previous ones. Even if Israel secures what they want in Gaza, it will be interesting to see if this will have any effect on the events to follow.",

According to Ukrainian sources, Russia launched 152 drones over Ukraine, 88 of which were reportedly shot down. Simultaneously, Ukrainian forces carried out strikes targeting the Zaporizhzhia and Voronezh nuclear power plants, raising significant concerns due to the risks to nuclear safety.\nReports indicate that the US administration's decision to provide Ukraine with missiles with a range of up to 2,500 km did not come as a surprise to the Kremlin.
