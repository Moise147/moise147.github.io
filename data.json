The true number of Tu-95MS that redeployed is unknown, but we should find out in the next 1-3 days.\nAdditionally, 1 Tu-95MS carried out a training mission from Engels-2 Airbase yesterday afternoon, where it carried out simulated launches of missiles with electronic warfare from the old launch lines, which are no longer used, over Guryanovo Training Ground, Saratov Oblast (the new launch lines are slightly further southwest near the village of Uzmore).\nInterestingly, this Tu-95MS from Engels-2 has not been known to conduct simulated launches of missiles over the past few months, and has only carried out ordinary, scheduled training missions, often for younger pilots. This could signal an imminent return to combat duty, alongside the other strategic bombers currently at Ukrainka Airbase.",

The northern part of the city remains a grey zone, with some more consolidation from the southeast. Small Russian and Ukrainian assault groups continue to clear each other out of positions in what has become a very fluid and dynamic area, with no defined line of contact.\nIn northeastern Pokrovsk, Ukrainian units in the high-rise part of the Dinas District have begun attempts at withdrawing to Rivne and appear to have been somewhat successful. However, they are withdrawing into a larger, cut-off pocket, so most/all of them won't escape the area. Russian building-by-building clearing operations continue in the Dinas District, where the Ukrainians are still putting up resistance. It's likely that the soldiers there are not fully aware of the situation in the bottleneck of the larger Myrnohrad pocket. Active clearing operations also continue in the shrinking grey zone in the low-rise residential areas of eastern Pokrovsk. \nAs for the bottleneck, Russian DRGs were able to infiltrate into the small, two-street residential area. If assault groups consolidate here, a physical encirclement of Myrnohrad will be made. But that would not make much difference, as any movement in and out of the city is practically impossible right now. Additionally, Russian DRGs infiltrated further to the next pig farm along the road to the rear of Pokrovsk and reached positions beyond it. No consolidation has occurred here yet.",
