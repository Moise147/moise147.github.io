This building was chosen as it is the only structure in the area that hasn't been flattened. I have circled it on the map (coordinates: 31.4887380, 34.4456188). \nMeanwhile, Palestinian armed groups such as the Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) and the Saraya Al-Quds Briagdes (PIJ) continued to carry out ambushes against Israeli forces, primarily utilising IEDs and anti-tank missiles, albeit at a lower rate than previously. \n+ ~0.43km¬≤ in favour of the IDF.",
