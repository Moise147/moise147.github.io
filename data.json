This is the first recorded presence of Palestinian militants in the area of Tulkarm City in some time.

An increase in insurgent activity has been recorded in the Nablus area over the past month, which has seen very little activity recently due to frequent and sustained IDF raids.\nNo Israeli casualties were reported in either of these incidents.\nAdditionally, the Saraya Al-Quds Brigades announced the death of a fighter from the local armed group \"Tubas Battalion\" after he was killed by IDF troops in the Al-Fara'a Refugee Camp.",

Because that’s what it would mean - mass mobilisation of additional Ukrainians would be condemning a significant portion of them to their deaths. They will die for a war that cannot be won. \nAll the while you have the audacity to claim that this is a good idea, while not being prepared to do anything yourself other than lie on Twitter for money and engagement. \nPeople like this are some of the most fucking vile, disgusting humans on this planet, and I truly hope that their statements will come back to haunt them once this war is over. \nYou do not support Ukraine.

Russian forces are also advancing elsewhere, while the Ukrainians continue their push through Rodynske.\nWest of Pokrovsk, Russian forces continued their relatively quick advance through the fields between the two railway lines. They were able to make additional progress north of Kotlyne, capturing new treeline positions on the tactical heights, and advancing further north towards the second railway line. They also completed the capture of the dachas on the southeastern outskirts of Hryshyne and established control over new treeline positions on approach to the village. \nIn Pokrovsk City, Russian forces continue attempts at consolidating in the northwestern-most street of the city, as well as the adjacent dachas. Ukrainian drone operators are attempting to prevent them from establishing this bridgehead over the Hrishynka River. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the eastern edge of Pokrovsk.\nSouth of Myrnohrad, Russian forces consolidated in the second large trench fortification north of Lysivka and entered northern Sukhyi Yar. In coordination with attacks carried out from the south and east, the Russians were able to complete the capture of the village. \nIn southern Myrnohrad, as a result of recent assault operations, Russian forces managed to entrench in the first high-rise buildings of the Zapadny District. They also improved their positions further in the low-rise residential streets to the south. \nIn northern Myrnohrad, Russian forces broke through towards the centre of the city along the T-504 Highway, capturing new parts of the low-rise residential areas. They also advanced further in the northern high-rise buildings, establishing control over most of the remaining buildings north of Mukhamadyeyeva Street.\nIn Rodynske, Ukrainian forces were able to achieve some progress in the southwestern part of the city, capturing new positions in 3 blocks of 4-story buildings, as well as the treeline to the west. They are now attempting to break through the city centre to the southeastern high-rise microdistrict. A large grey zone has formed there.",
