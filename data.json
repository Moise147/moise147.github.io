Fierce fighting ensued for around 24 hours, with the Russians being forced to retreat south due to the loss of Vesele and Hruzke, as well as because of Ukraine's numerical superiority here. Those same forces then pushed south and have reached the northern outskirts of Kucheriv Yar. \nAdditionally, after days of positional battles, Ukrainian forces pushed east from their positions in Rubizhne, and recaptured the rest of the village, which Russia had to withdraw from due to the loss of Zolotyi Kolodyaz. From there, Ukrainian forces pushed further and captured treeline positions on the nearby tactical heights, and in the gulley leading south from Zolotyi Kolodyaz.\nTo the south, the Ukrainians pushed outwards from Stepy, establishing a buffer zone in the treelines on the tactical heights there, while other forces moved along the heights to Vilne, which also came under their control.\nFurthermore, Ukrainian forces advanced east from Novyi Donbas, and entered the village of Nove Shakhove, capturing the western houses. They were also able to recapture the village of Ivanivka, as well as  Dorozhnje, which allowed for them to re-enter Nykanorivka which is now partially in the grey zone. \nRussian forces on the other hand, were able to improve their positions west of Shakhove around a week ago, advancing downhill through two parallel gulleys, capturing positions in the forest plantations there. \n+ ~60.60km¬≤ in favour of Ukraine.\n+ ~6.78km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

While the claims of large groups of Russians being encircled are likely false, Deepstate and Azov were correct in saying that Ukraine was able to significantly advance. I doubted them, and I was wrong. \nNow let's see what happens in these areas where Ukrainian reinforcements were pulled from, namely the Kostyantynivka direction.
