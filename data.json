In the north, they continued to improve their positions north of Serednje, capturing positions in the grey zone and securing their logistics into the village from the north. They also reached the nearby orchards and captured positions in the adjacent treeline. \nTo the south, Russian forces crossed the gulley from Serednje, and captured the small forest and nearby treelines there. From here, they crossed the Nitrius River to the eastern bank, capturing the northern part of Shandryholove. This, plus advances from the north and east allowed for the Russians to establish control over the local school which previously served as Ukraine's main defensive node. Other forces who crossed over the river from southern Shandryholove then helped clear the rest of the village. \nA few hours later, Ukrainian forces re-infiltrated the western part of the village, and after a series of clashes, were pushed back across the river. Additionally, after a series of attempts, Russian forces secured a bridgehead on the western bank of the Nitrius river southwest of Shandryholove, and captured the agricultural complex and nearby treelines.\nIn the south, Russian forces continued their assault on Derylove. They were able to marginally advance down the road west of the village, allowing for the western houses to be captured. They also secured the rest of the forested areas north of the gulley that runs along the northern edge of the settlement.\n+ ~10.96 km² in favour of Russia.",

They are also continuing to bypass the clearings southwest of Torske and are continuing to infiltrate the northern streets of Yampil near the railway station.\nIn eastern Yampil, Russian forces were finally able to consolidate after attacks were carried out from the forest to the east and the area of the Ostrich Farm to the northeast. Fighting is now ongoing for the rest of the eastern streets and the centre of the village, which are mostly in the grey zone. \nTo the east, Russian forces advanced from the area of the Sererbryanskyi Forest, securing new positions in the forests on the Donetsk side of the regional border. They also crossed the Siverskyi Donets River, establishing control over positions in and around the holiday houses on the Donetsk-Luhansk regional border. \n+ ~6.70 km² in favour of Russia.",

The reason for the operation is still unknown as Wagner withdrew its open support of RSF in 2021 to provide Moscow the opportunity to establish ties with the Iran-backed Sudanese government.\nThe area of Wagner's operation are also critical to RSF, in that a large volume of military aid flows from UAE cargo planes landing at Birao Air Port, CAR (at \n10.23706, 22.71983\n), and then using route RN8 to enter Sudanese territory. The route is vital for the Battle of al-Fashir, as it supplies two key RSF airbases, Durri (at \n12.95862, 23.62721\n) and Zalingei (at \n12.94501, 23.56407\n).",

      "original": "\"Trump has done a full 180 in his view on Ukraine\".\n\"Trump has received intelligence that changed his mind about how this war can end\".\nThese are the things that are being spread all across the \"Pro-Ukraine\" information space over the past few hours, and all of this is only going to turn out to be another \"fell for it again award\" moment. \nMany of these people commenting SHOULD be old enough to recognise how politicians operate. Trump has consistently lied about so much for over 10 years - including Ukraine. Remember his claim that he will personally end the war in 24 hours? That's been memory-holed by all those who advocated for his presidency last year. \nDon't blindly trust anything that politicians say... especially if its Trump. Everything they say is being said for a reason, and when it comes to an aging empire like the U.S., there is much more of an incentive to say things purely for informational effect.\nSo that being said, I think these are the two most plausible outcomes that could come from this:\n1. Trump is going to increase aid to Ukraine and greenlight a lot of new weapons in order to prolong this war and buy more time to focus on more important threats to dying U.S. hegemony. This would also fuel a diminishing false sense of hope in Ukrainian society. \n2. Trump is lying again and will do little to nothing to change his current policy on Ukraine, and all this is for informational effect to fuel a diminishing false sense of hope in Ukrainian society.\nNotice a pattern here? The U.S. has a vested interest in keeping this war going with both of these options, but the purpose is largely the same - prolong the war, keep Ukraine in the fight a little longer, and hurt Russia a little more. \nDo you see what I mean when I've consistently said that Trump doesn't want peace in Ukraine?",
