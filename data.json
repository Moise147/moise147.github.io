This map below shows areas where Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been recorded, although this doesn't necessarily show consolidation. In the future, once the situation clears up and one side clearly regains the initiative, the map will be updated to show additional control zones. But for now, it will look something like this.\nThis has happened due to the large open areas here, with limited cover from treelines and individual, isolated buildings. Additionally, Ukraine's manpower shortages have forced them to resort to increased drone usage. Kostyantynivka provides practically endless hiding spots for drone operators, while Russia has Chasiv Yar and the surrounding forests and villages to use for this. Both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers are operating in small assault groups of usually 2-4 people, clearing each other out of their positions. A similar situation was observed (and still is to some extent) in the Dobropillya direction.\nMeanwhile, extensive preparatory bombing and shelling continues on Kostyantynivka, primarily targeting its eastern districts, ahead of the Russian storming operation on the city.",
