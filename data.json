From there, they pushed northeast up four parallel residential streets towards the E-50 highway, which they are now operating in the vicinity of. The Russians were also able to re-establish control over the surroundings of the terykon next to Leontovychi, and after roughly five days of fighting, secured the western half of the village of Troyanda. The eastern half is in the grey-zone, with both sides regularly operating there.\nTo the southeast, after pausing their attacks on Chunyshyne, Russian forces were finally able to establish control over the guitar-shaped trench fortification northeast of Zelene, while other forces captured the rest of the forests north of Dachenske. They were also able to capture most of a treeline northwest of Lysivka.\n+ ~7.62km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

The village quickly came under Russian control due to additional progress being made towards Ternove from the southeast. \nTo the northeast, after capturing Novoheorhiivka, Russian forces began their operation to capture Komyshuvakha. Ukraine had a much larger presence here, so Russia opted to encircle the settlement instead. They advanced north up the treelines on the tactical heights west of the village, and west from Shevchenko to the rear of Komyshuvakha, forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw to the northwest to avoid being cut off. \nAt the same time, Russian forces spearheaded west along the Vorona River, capturing the village of Vorone. Ukrainian forces counterattacked and managed to retake some positions there, but after back-and-forth fighting, Russia pushed them out once again and consolidated there. This was helped in part by the capture of the treelines on the heights southwest of Sichneve, improving their supply. Russian supply was already relatively unhindered as Ukrainian drone operators were caught off-guard in frontline settlements and had to take the time to redeploy and set up further in the rear, resulting in a significant decrease in Ukrainian FPV drone usage. \nTo the north, Russian forces were able to approach Sichneve from the east, before breaking through Ukrainian lines north of the village to the Vovcha River. They moved west down a gulley, capturing positions in the forest plantations, and entered the northern part of Novoselivka, although it's unclear if any positions have been established. They were also able to capture treeline positions on the heights north of the gulley used to enter Novoselivka.\nIn the north, Russian forces recaptured previously lost positions in the treelines east of Oleksandrohrad, forcing the Ukrainians to pull back into the village.\n+ ~42.76km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "Regarding the situation in the Orikhiv direction, western Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\nBoth Russian and Ukrainian sources are reporting that Russian forces carried out ground attacks on Mala Tokmachka and Novodanylivka..\nRussian sources reported that Russian forces resumed assault operations in Mala Tokmachka, although it's unclear where from. The last known western-most Russian positions in the village were at the local school in the village centre, although it's unclear if those positions were retained. Ukrainian sources report that the Russian attacks were repelled by Ukrainian FPV drone operators but did not provide additional details.\nRussian sources also reported that attacks took place on Novodanylivka. Currently, there is a massive grey zone stretching from the areas north of Robotyne to the southern outskirts of Novodanylivka, however, Russian forces (likely from the 3rd assault company of the 291st regiment) managed to enter the southern houses of the village. It is currently unclear if they were able to establish any positions there, however. \nThese reports are corroborated by Sentinel imagery, which shows a massive increase in fires burning both on the frontline, and in Ukrainian controlled territory north of Mala Tokmachka on August 29. Almost all of these fires burnt out by August 30. Some small damage to buildings in Mala Tokmachka, likely from FPV drones, was recorded in the central part of the village, but nothing to suggest increased usage in that area.\nAdditionally, according to my information, large artillery duels and FAB bombardment has occurred south of Zaporizhzhia City since August 28. Heavy artillery shelling targeted Ukrainian positions in the area for around an hour straight in the early hours of the morning on August 31. At least 16 glide-bombs were dropped on Ukrainian positions at around 11:30pm for a period of roughly 20 minutes on August 30. Significant FAB bombardment also targeted the town of Malokaterynivka, around 14km south of Zaporizhzhia City on the night of August 28-29, resulting in large fires burning uncontrolled in the dachas and residential areas for over 24 hours. Russian artillery shelling did continue through to August 31, albeit at a decreased rate, and some of it was concentrated on areas west of Orikhiv.",

      "original": "Recent Russian strategic bomber movements suggests that another large-scale combined missile attack on Ukraine is imminent. \nFollowing the strikes on August 31, most of the bombers returned to airbases close to Ukraine and remained there, rather than flying to the far east for equipment with Kh-101 cruise missiles as usual. 2 Tu-95s landed at Olenya Airbase, Murmansk Oblast, 1 Tu-95 landed at Engels-2 Airbase, Saratov Oblast, and 1 Tu-95 landed at Diaghilev Airbase, Ryazan Oblast. \nCurrently, the following aircraft are located near Ukraine:\nOlenya Airbase: 2 Tu-95MS\nEngels-2 Airbase: 3 Tu-95MS, 1 Tu-160\nDiaghilev Airbase: 3 Tu-95MS.\n2 of the Tu-95s at Engels-2 have been equipped with missiles. The status of the third is unknown. Notably, the number of flights to Diaghilev has increased, with one of the aircraft which took part in the most recent combat flight landing there afterwards. \nAs for the Tu-160 that launched missiles during the most recent attack, it flew to Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast, in the far east where it is probably also being equipped with Kh-101 cruise missiles. \nIt is also important to remember that for around 2 weeks, Russian decreased their usage of Iskander-M ballistic missiles, Iskander-K cruise missiles, and significantly decreased their usage of Geran-2 drones. This indicates that stockpiles were built up of these weapons, and while they will have burnt through a decent amount of them since then, there will still be a lot left over.",
