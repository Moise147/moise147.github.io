They were able to enter Zolotyi Kolodyaz where they engaged in clashes with disorganised and unprepared Ukrainian soldiers. Nevertheless, Ukraine was able to maintain control over the village, however the grey zone now extends to its southern outskirts.\nNormal Russian assault detachments then followed the DRGs, pushing north down the treelines on the tactical heights, and capturing the positions on either side, including on the edges of three different quarries. They were able to reach the southern edge of the Velyka Balka Gulley, and pushed north along it, following the initial path of the DRGs. Russian forces captured positions in this gulley, in three smaller gulleys branching off to the east and west, and in the nearby treelines at the edge of the tactical heights. \nMeanwhile, further south, reinforcements were brought in to support the assault operations. These reinforcements began attacking the flanks, where they entered the village of Nove Shakhove and captured positions in its eastern houses. The Russians were also able to establish control over the rest of the Hetkova Balka Gulley, while other forces approached the eastern outskirts of Vilne. \nTo the east of this breakthrough, Russian forces continued to advance towards Shakhove, and completed the capture of Pankivka, aligning with the front on the opposite bank of the Kazenyi Torets River in Volodymyrivka. Positions were also seized in the treelines on the tactical heights to the west. \nTo the southwest of the breakthrough, Russian forces continued to assault the Ukrainian strongpoints at the Dorozhnje Freight Train Station, and in the adjacent village of the same name. DRGs are also continuing to infiltrate to the south of Bilytske, reaching the Dobropillya - Pokrovsk Highway.\n+ ~22.20km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

      "original": "With this new breakthrough, Russian DRGs are now within 4.5km of the Dobropillya-Kramatorsk Highway., and Russian assault units are within 6.7km \nIf Russian soldiers can capture Zolotyi Kolodyaz, this highway will become unusable for Ukrainian forces, meaning they can only use the Oleksandrivka-Kramatorsk highway to reach Kramatorsk from the west, and subsequently supply Druzhkivka, Kostyantynivka and all the surrounding areas there. \nOf course, this breakthrough may have been opportunistic in nature, and Russia may not even be trying to cut the highway at this moment. They will need to do a lot of consolidation and bring up significant reinforcements to secure this wedge - let alone exploit and expand it. But this development towards the highway is not a good sign for Ukraine, not only from a logistical view, but simply the fact that it happened, and that it happened so suddenly and quickly. \nQuoting Deepstate, Ukraine's manpower situation in the Pokrovsk direction is \"catastrophic\". Major efforts will need to take place in order to constrain and contain this breakthrough, but a lot of it depends on what Russia is focusing on, and how many focuses they have. \nAlso, interesting to note is that the Donetsk OVA head announced that this highway would be closed to all civilian vehicles less than 4 weeks ago on July 16. At that time, the frontline was around 17km away, significantly more than today's 6.7km. It's become clear that these measures come in advance of Russian successes that the Ukrainian command knows are imminent. \nTake the mandatory evacuation orders for families with children from Kramatorsk for example. This occurred shortly before Russia captured Chasiv Yar. \nAnother example is the mandatory evacuation orders of families with children from Dobropillya, which occurred just before the breakthrough to Bilytske. \nOverall, Ukraine's manpower shortages are reaching levels not seen before in this war. Mobilisation is only slowing the inevitable, and these breakthroughs are only set to become larger and more frequent.",

Now Trump and Putin have agreed to meet in Alaska on August 15, meaning that it's unlikely that this attack will take place any time before August 17 so as not to tarnish Russia's image of seeking a peaceful resolution to the war. \nHowever, Russia has not been quiet behind the scenes. Accumulation of Geran-2 drones, Kh-101 cruise missiles, and Iskander-M ballistic missiles has been taking place.\nSince the last combined missile attack 13 days ago on July 28, 7 IL-76MD military transport aircraft have made flights to Engels-2 Airbase in Saratov Oblast, which is the main airbase used for equipping Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers. 4 Tu-95s are currently stationed at Engels-2, and have been there for over four days, which is a very rare phenomenon recently for this base. Three of these bombers have been conducting nightly training for young pilots, while one is undergoing active maintenance. \nAs for Gerans, very few have been launched over the past 5 days, with no more than 50 per night. While it may seem like a lot from the reports, the vast majority of them are Gerbera drones, which have no warhead and aim to waste and further overwhelm Ukrainian air defence. This means that Gerans are being accumulated at the different launch points for usage in the next combined missile attacks. \nIskanders have also not been used much lately, with some days not witnessing a single strike. This also indicates accumulation, especially in Voronezh, Bryansk and Rostov Oblasts.",
