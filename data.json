      "original": "This video went semi-viral today, with people using it to claim that Palestinian armed resistance in the West Bank is resurging once again. \nOne thing to realise is that following Israel's Operation Iron Walls, the Palestinian militant cells in the West Bank have mostly either been dismantled or dispersed out of major population centres. The IDF still occupies the two main centres of resistance: Tulkarm and Jenin. I estimate that there were roughly 500 members of the Jenin Battalion and the different groups in Tulkarm as of late 2024, all of which are now dead, disarmed, or no longer operating in either city. \nInstead, we have seen a shift to operations in the surrounding villages, especially in Jenin Governorate, which eventually prompted the IDF to expand Operation Iron Walls to those areas. So as of now, there are still probably quite a few militant cells active in the northern West Bank, but they will all be disorganised and disconnected, mostly dormant, waiting for the Israeli operations to end, so they can make some form of attempts at reconstructing back in major population centres. The only other cities which have active fighters in them would be Nablus, Tubas, and the town of Tamoun, but due to repeated Israeli storming operations this year in Tamoun and Tubas, and in 2022-2023 in Nablus, these groups are largely dismantled. \nSo, what about this video? Well, it claims to show Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fighters operating freely in the West Bank. Because of these Israeli operations and the inability for any larger groupings of fighters to gather right now, it is likely an old video filmed in the Jenin Refugee Camp, and possibly with other areas spliced together, for propaganda effect. As I've said before, this doesn't necessarily mean these groups won't return to more organised, almost Hamas-style, resistance in the future after regrouping and recruiting new young fighters to refill their ranks, but right now this seems practically impossible to me.",
