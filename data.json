At least 7 more KAB glide-bombs hit targets in the city limits, and on the outskirts, while MLRS shelling targeted the southern suburbs. Geran-2 drones also flew over the city but did not strike anything as they were transiting north. \nStrengthened Ukrainian air defence in Zaporizhzhia is showing its effects. At least four Gerans have been shot down, along with two glide-bombs. \nAdditionally, targets from the previous attacks were identified. The auto-repair shop at 47.82259, 35.14838 was hit, along with the Motor Sich Plant in multiple places. However, electronic warfare seems to be affecting the accuracy of these bombs, as one that intended to hit the auto-repair shop missed by around 40 metres, and another aimed at the Motor Sich plant hit houses around 60 metres away across the street (47.83129, 35.19627).",

In the north, they continued to improve their positions north of Serednje, capturing positions in the grey zone and securing their logistics into the village from the north. They also reached the nearby orchards and captured positions in the adjacent treeline. \nTo the south, Russian forces crossed the gulley from Serednje, and captured the small forest and nearby treelines there. From here, they crossed the Nitrius River to the eastern bank, capturing the northern part of Shandryholove. This, plus advances from the north and east allowed for the Russians to establish control over the local school which previously served as Ukraine's main defensive node. Other forces who crossed over the river from southern Shandryholove then helped clear the rest of the village. \nA few hours later, Ukrainian forces re-infiltrated the western part of the village, and after a series of clashes, were pushed back across the river. Additionally, after a series of attempts, Russian forces secured a bridgehead on the western bank of the Nitrius river southwest of Shandryholove, and captured the agricultural complex and nearby treelines.\nIn the south, Russian forces continued their assault on Derylove. They were able to marginally advance down the road west of the village, allowing for the western houses to be captured. They also secured the rest of the forested areas north of the gulley that runs along the northern edge of the settlement.\n+ ~10.96 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

They are also continuing to bypass the clearings southwest of Torske and are continuing to infiltrate the northern streets of Yampil near the railway station.\nIn eastern Yampil, Russian forces were finally able to consolidate after attacks were carried out from the forest to the east and the area of the Ostrich Farm to the northeast. Fighting is now ongoing for the rest of the eastern streets and the centre of the village, which are mostly in the grey zone. \nTo the east, Russian forces advanced from the area of the Sererbryanskyi Forest, securing new positions in the forests on the Donetsk side of the regional border. They also crossed the Siverskyi Donets River, establishing control over positions in and around the holiday houses on the Donetsk-Luhansk regional border. \n+ ~6.70 km¬≤ in favour of Russia.",

The reason for the operation is still unknown as Wagner withdrew its open support of RSF in 2021 to provide Moscow the opportunity to establish ties with the Iran-backed Sudanese government.\nThe area of Wagner's operation are also critical to RSF, in that a large volume of military aid flows from UAE cargo planes landing at Birao Air Port, CAR (at \n10.23706, 22.71983\n), and then using route RN8 to enter Sudanese territory. The route is vital for the Battle of al-Fashir, as it supplies two key RSF airbases, Durri (at \n12.95862, 23.62721\n) and Zalingei (at \n12.94501, 23.56407\n).",
