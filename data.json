After repelling Russian assaults on northern Volodymyrivka, and inflicting heavy casualties on the initial force dropped off by the earlier mechanised assault, Ukrainian forces began attacking south from the northern street with their newly accumulated infantry, and captured new residential areas in the northern part of the village.

They advanced for at least 1 km to the west (north of the railway line), while DRGs began infiltrating even deeper towards the southeastern outskirts of Lyman itself. Additionally, as a result of the advances being made in the forests to the south and north, the Russians closed the salient southwest of Zarichne, establishing control over 6 treelines and the northern part of the Yampil Forest. \n+ ~19.56 in favour of Russia.",
