However, Russian forces are attempting to advance from the treelines to the southwest in the direction of Vilne, but it is unclear if they have had any successes. \nOn the other hand, Ukrainian forces continued their counterattacks in the Druzhkivka direction and have eliminated the Russian spearhead to Sofiivka.
