However, now ground-based static launchers have been constructed to the west of the main launchers, which take less time and resources for launching drones. \nWhile it doesn't appear that this expansion is fully complete yet, we will likely see an increase in the number of drones launched from here in the near future. Additionally, Navlya is the only launch site north/northeast of Ukraine where Geran-3 jet drones can be launched.\nImage credit:\nStrategicaviationT on Telegram\nUkrainian_Intelligence on Telegram",

This further secured Russian supply lines leading to Kucheriv Yar at the peak of the salient. It also put more pressure on the Ukrainian pocket splitting the salient from Shakhove to Toret‚Äôske.\nTo the south of the salient, battles continue in Pokrovsk with clear advantage to the Tsentr Group of Forces.
