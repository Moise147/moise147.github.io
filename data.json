Other forces improved their positions along the treeline towards the eastern part of the mine. Heavy fighting continues on the approaches of this very important fortified node.\nWest of Pokrovsk, Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences north of Kotlyne, capturing positions in the treelines to the north and northwest. They then went on to advance further northeast to the next treelines over on the tactical heights, while other forces pushed north from the railway line. Additionally, Russian forces captured numerous new treeline positions closer to Pokrovsk and made additional progress along the railway line to the south of Hryshyne, where they are beginning to outflank the Ukrainian positions in the rest of those treelines. \nIn northern Pokrovsk, under the cover of fog, additional Russian reinforcements were brought from the city centre to help the units who were struggling to consolidate in the northern residential areas of the 8th District. The remaining Ukrainian assault groups were forced to retreat from this part of the city, allowing for the Russians to establish full control over the district. Additionally, Russian forces advanced northwest from the low-rise part of the Dinas District to the nearby forested areas, while other forces in the 8th District advanced north to the forested areas just outside the city, forcing most Ukrainian formations to withdraw much further west - away from the Myrnohrad Pocket. \nIn northwestern Pokrovsk, after establishing control over and consolidating in the Shcherbakova District, Russian soldiers began infiltrating north across the Hryshinka River to the northernmost street of Pokrovsk and the Druzhba Dachas, where they are now trying to consolidate. Fighting is ongoing as Ukrainian forces attempt to prevent the Russians from securing this area as it would build a buffer outside the main part of the city and help develop the eastern flank to Hryshyne. \nNorth of Pokrovsk, Russian forces continued advancing down the road to Hryshyne and have captured additional positions there. They also advanced down a perpendicular treeline to the north. Assault groups then began attacking towards the next pig farm over, while DRGs infiltrated towards the third pig farm. DRGs also began infiltrating southwest through the treelines towards the northern outskirts of Pokrovsk\nNortheast of the city, Russian forces continued their assault operations in southern Rivne, attacking along the highway in the direction of northwestern Myrnohrad. In eastern Pokrovsk, other they began attacks from the Sobachivka District to the \"Kohozhkine\" street of Pokrovsk - the last street in the eastern part of the city. \nSouth of Myrnohrad, after capturing the last parts of Lysivka, Russian forces were able to capture the rest of the forests north of the village. They also consolidated in a large trench fortification further north and are attacking east down a treeline to the other one. Additionally, the Russians began attacks north up a treeline from eastern Lysivka to the western part of Sukhyi Yar. \nIn southeastern Myrnohrad, Russian forces continued assault operations from the area of the terykon to residential areas in the area of Dymytrov Park. They are also attacking towards the area of the high-rise buildings in the Zapadny District.\n(Part 2 is below)",
